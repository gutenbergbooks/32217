<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>This rendering of some of the old Czechoslovak tales
is not offered as a literal translation or a scholarly
translation. I have retold the stories in a way that I
hope will please American children. I have tried
hard to keep the flavor of the originals but have taken
the liberty of a short cut here and an elaboration there
wherever these have seemed to me to make the English
version clearer and more interesting.</p>

<p>I have gone to Czech, Slovakian, and Moravian
sources. All these stories appear in many versions
in the different folklore collections made by such native
writers as Erben, Nemcova, Dobsinsky, Rimavsky,
Benes-Trebizsky, Kulda. They represent the folk-tale
in all stages of its development from the bald narrative
of <i>The Bird with the Golden Gizzard</i> which Kulda reports
with phonographic exactness, to Nemcova&rsquo;s more
elaborate tale, <i>Prince Bayaya</i>, which is really a mosaic
of two or three simpler stories. I have included
<i>Katcha and the Devil</i> for the sake of its keen humor,
which is particularly Czech in character; <i>The Betrothal
Gifts</i> to show how a story common to other countries
is made most charmingly local by giving it a local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
background; <i>The Three Golden Hairs</i> to contrast it
with a famous German variant which it seems to me
is much inferior to the Slavic version; and several fine
stories of the prince gone off on adventures which
in common with the folk-tales of all Europe show a
strong Oriental influence.</p>

<p>In the transliteration of proper names I have not
followed consistently any one method, but for each individual
name have made what seemed to be the best
selection from the various possible spellings. Until
transliteration from the Slavic languages has become
standardized this, I am sure, is permissible and even
advisable.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this volume I have made
heavy draughts upon the scholarship and patience of
my Czech friends, Mrs. Jan Matulka and Mr. Vladimir
Jelinek. I beg them to accept my thanks. I
am also deeply grateful to Mr. A.&nbsp;B. Koukol, who did
me the favor of reading the final sheets. Lastly I wish
to express my appreciation of the Webster Branch of
the New York Public Library, which has gathered
together what is probably the most complete collection
of Czechoslovak literature in America, and one particularly
rich in folklore and children&rsquo;s books.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">LONGSHANKS, GIRTH, AND KEEN</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an aged king who had an only
son. One day he called the prince to him and
said: &ldquo;My dear son, you know that ripe fruit falls in
order to make room for other fruit. This my old head
is like ripe fruit and soon the sun will no longer shine
upon it. Now before I die I should like to see you
happily married. Get you a wife, my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, my father, that I could please you in
this,&rdquo; the prince answered, &ldquo;but I know of no one who
would make you a worthy daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old king reached into his pocket, drew out a
golden key, and handed it to the prince. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go up into the tower to the very top. There
look about you and when you have decided what you
like best of all you see, come back and tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince took the key and at once mounted the
tower. He had never before gone to the very top
and he had never heard what was there. He went up
and up until at last he saw a small iron door in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
ceiling. He opened this with the golden key, pushed
it back, and entered a large circular hall. The ceiling
was blue and silver like the heavens on a bright night
when the stars shine, and the floor was covered with a
green silken carpet. There were twelve tall windows
set in gold frames, and on the crystal glass of each
window a beautiful young girl was pictured in glowing
colors. Every one of them was a princess with a
royal crown upon her head. As the prince looked at
them it seemed to him that each was more lovely than
the last, and for the life of him he knew not which
was the loveliest. Then they began to move as if alive,
and they smiled at the prince and nodded, and looked
as if they were about to speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly the prince noticed that one of the twelve
windows was covered with a white curtain. He pulled
the curtain aside and there without any question was
the most beautiful princess of them all, clothed in pure
white, with a silver girdle and a crown of pearls. Her
face was deathly pale and sad as the grave.</p>

<p>For a long time the prince stood before this picture
in utter amazement and as he looked at it a pain
seemed to enter his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one I want for my bride,&rdquo; he said aloud,
&ldquo;this one and no other.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
At these words the maiden bowed, flushed like a
rose, and then instantly all the pictures disappeared.</p>

<p>When the prince told his father what he had seen
and which maiden he had chosen, the old king was
greatly troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you did ill to uncover what
was covered and in declaring this, your choice, you
have exposed yourself to a great danger. This maiden
is in the power of a black magician who holds her
captive in an iron castle. Of all who have gone to
rescue her not one has ever returned. However, what&rsquo;s
done is done and you have given your word. Go, then,
try what fortune has in store for you, and may Heaven
bring you back safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the prince bade his father farewell, mounted his
horse, and rode forth to find his bride. His first adventure
was to lose his way in a deep forest. He
wandered about some time not knowing where to turn
when suddenly he was hailed from behind with these
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there, master, wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked around and saw a tall man running
toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me into your service, master,&rdquo; the tall man
said. &ldquo;If you do you won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
&ldquo;What is your name,&rdquo; the prince asked, &ldquo;and
what can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People call me Longshanks because I can stretch
myself out. I&rsquo;ll show you. Do you see a bird&rsquo;s nest in
the top of that tall fir? I&rsquo;ll get it down for you
and not by climbing the tree either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying he began to stretch out and his body
shot up and up until he was as tall as the fir tree.
He reached over and got the nest and then, in a shorter
time than it had taken him to stretch out, he reduced
himself to his natural size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do your trick very well,&rdquo; the prince said,
&ldquo;but just now a bird&rsquo;s nest isn&rsquo;t of much use to me.
What I need is some one to show me the way out
of this forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Longshanks said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s an easy enough
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he began to stretch himself up and up and
up until he was three times as tall as the highest pine
in the forest. He looked around and said: &ldquo;Over
there, in that direction, is the nearest way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he made himself small again, took the horse
by the bridle, walked ahead, and in a short time they
emerged from the forest.</p>

<p>A broad plain stretched out before them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
beyond it they could see tall gray rocks that looked like
the walls of a great city and mountains overgrown
with forests.</p>

<p>Longshanks pointed off across the plain and said:
&ldquo;There, master, goes a comrade of mine who would
be very useful to you. You ought to take him into
your service too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;call him here that
I may find out what sort of a fellow he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is too far away to call,&rdquo; Longshanks said.
&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t hear my voice and if he did he would
be a long time in reaching us, for he has much to
carry. I had better step over and get him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, Longshanks stretched out and
out until his head was lost in the clouds. He took
two or three strides, reached his comrade, set him on
his shoulder, and brought him to the prince.</p>

<p>The new man was heavily built and round as a
barrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the prince asked. &ldquo;And what
can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Girth,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I can widen
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see you do it,&rdquo; the prince said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, master,&rdquo; said Girth, beginning to puff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
out, &ldquo;I will. But take care! Ride off into the forest
as fast as you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince did not understand the warning, but he
saw that Longshanks was in full flight, so he spurred
his horse and galloped after him.</p>

<p>It was just as well he did, for in another moment
Girth would have crushed both him and his horse,
so fast did he spread out, so huge did he become. In
a short time he filled the whole plain until it looked
as though a mountain had fallen upon it.</p>

<p>When the plain was entirely covered, he stopped
expanding, heaved a deep breath that shook the forest
trees, and returned to his natural size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made me run for my life!&rdquo; the prince said.
&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t meet a fellow like you every
day! By all means join me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went across the plain and as they neared
the rocks they met a man whose eyes were bandaged
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Longshanks, &ldquo;there is my other
comrade. Take him into your service, too, and I can
tell you you won&rsquo;t regret the bread he eats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the prince asked. &ldquo;And why do
you keep your eyes bandaged? You can&rsquo;t see where
you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
&ldquo;On the contrary, master, it is just because I see
too well that I have to bandage my eyes. With
bandaged eyes I see as well as other people whose
eyes are uncovered. When I take the handkerchief
off, my sight is so keen it goes straight through everything.
When I look at anything intently it catches
fire, and if it can&rsquo;t burn, it crumbles to pieces. On
account of my sight I&rsquo;m called Keen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He untied the handkerchief, turned to one of the
rocks opposite, and gazed at it with glowing eyes.
Soon the rock began to crumble and fall to pieces.
In a few moments it was reduced to a heap of sand.
In the sand something gleamed like fire. Keen picked
it up and handed it to the prince. It was a lump of
pure gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;You are a fine fellow
and worth more than wages! I should be a fool not
to take you into my service. Since you have such
keen eyes, look and tell me how much farther it is
to the Iron Castle and what is happening there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you rode there alone,&rdquo; Keen answered, &ldquo;you
might get there within a year, but with us to help
you, you will arrive this very day. Our coming is
not unexpected, either, for at this very moment they
are preparing supper for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
&ldquo;What is the captive princess doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is sitting in a high tower behind an iron grating.
The magician stands on guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are real men,&rdquo; the prince cried, &ldquo;you
will all help me to free her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three comrades promised they would.</p>

<p>They led the prince straight through the gray rocks
by a defile which Keen made with his eyes, and on
and on through high mountains and deep forests.
Whatever obstacle was in the way one or another of
the three comrades was able to remove it.</p>

<p>By late afternoon they had crossed the last mountain,
had left behind them the last stretch of dark
forest, and they saw looming up ahead of them the
Iron Castle.</p>

<p>Just as the sun sank the prince and his followers
crossed the drawbridge and entered the courtyard gate.
Instantly the drawbridge lifted and the gate clanged
shut.</p>

<p>They went through the courtyard and the prince put
his horse in the stable, where he found a place all in
readiness. Then the four of them marched boldly into
the castle.</p>

<p>Everywhere&mdash;in the courtyard, in the stables, and
now in the various rooms of the castle&mdash;they saw great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
numbers of richly clad men all of whom, masters and
servants alike, had been turned to stone.</p>

<p>They went on from one room to another until they
reached the banquet hall. This was brilliantly lighted
and the table, with food and drink in abundance, was
set for four persons. They waited, expecting some
one to appear, but no one came. At last, overpowered
by hunger, they sat down and ate and drank most
heartily.</p>

<p>After supper they began to look about for a place
to sleep. It was then without warning that the doors
burst open and the magician appeared. He was a bent
old man with a bald head and a gray beard that
reached to his knees. He was dressed in a long black
robe and he had, instead of a belt, three iron bands
about his waist.</p>

<p>He led in a beautiful lady dressed in white with
a silver girdle and a crown of pearls. Her face was
deathly pale and as sad as the grave. The prince
recognized her instantly and sprang forward to meet
her. Before he could speak, the magician raised his
hand and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know why you have come. It is to carry off
this princess. Very well, take her. If you can guard
her for three nights so that she won&rsquo;t escape you, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
is yours. But if she escapes you, then you and your
men will suffer the fate of all those who have come
before you and be turned into stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then when he had motioned the princess to a seat,
he turned and left the hall.</p>

<p>The prince could not take his eyes from the princess,
she was so beautiful. He tried to talk to her, asking
her many questions, but she made him no answer. She
might have been marble the way she never smiled and
never looked at any of them.</p>

<p>He seated himself beside her, determined to stay all
night on guard in order to prevent her escape. For
greater security Longshanks stretched himself out on
the floor like a strap and wound himself around the
room the whole length of the wall. Girth sat in the
doorway and puffed himself out until he filled that
space so completely that not even a mouse could slip
through. Keen took his place by a pillar in the middle
of the hall.</p>

<p>But, alas, in a few moments they all grew heavy
with drowsiness and in the end slept soundly all night
long.</p>

<p>In the morning in the early dawn the prince awoke
and with a pain in his heart that was like a blow from
a dagger, he saw that the princess was gone. Instantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
he aroused his men and asked them what was to be
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, master, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said Keen as
he took a long look through the window. &ldquo;I see her
now. A hundred miles from here is a forest, in the
midst of the forest an ancient oak, on the top of the
oak an acorn. The princess is that acorn. Let Longshanks
take me on his shoulders and we&rsquo;ll go get her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Longshanks picked Keen up, stretched himself out,
and set forth. He took ten miles at a stride and in
the time it would take you or me to run around a
cottage, here he was back again with the acorn in his
hand. He gave it to the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it, master, on the floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince dropped the acorn and instantly the
princess appeared.</p>

<p>As the sun came over the mountain tops the doors
slammed open and the magician entered. A crafty
smile was on his face. But when he saw the princess
the smile changed to a scowl, he growled in rage, and
bang! one of the iron bands about his waist burst
asunder. Then he took the princess by the hand and
dragged her off.</p>

<p>That whole day the prince had nothing to do but
wander about the castle and look at all the strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
and curious things it contained. It seemed as if at
some one instant all life had been arrested. In one
hall he saw a prince who had been turned into stone
while he was brandishing his sword. The sword was
still uplifted. In another room there was a stone
knight who was taken in the act of flight. He had
stumbled on the threshold but he had not yet fallen.
A serving man sat under the chimney eating his supper.
With one hand he was reaching a piece of roast
meat to his mouth. Days, months, perhaps years had
gone by, but the meat had not yet touched his lips.
There were many others, all of them still in whatever
position they happened to be when the magician had
cried: &ldquo;Be ye turned into stone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the courtyard and the stables the prince found
many fine horses overtaken by the same fate.</p>

<p>Outside the castle everything was equally dead and
silent. There were trees but they had no leaves, there
was a river but it didn&rsquo;t flow, and no fish could live
in its waters. There wasn&rsquo;t a singing bird anywhere,
and there wasn&rsquo;t even one tiny flower.</p>

<p>In the morning, at noon, and at supper-time the
prince and his companions found a rich feast prepared
for them. Unseen hands served them food and poured
them wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
Then after supper, as on the preceding night, the
doors burst open and the magician led in the princess,
whom he handed over to the prince to guard for the
second night.</p>

<p>Of course the prince and his men determined to
fight off drowsiness this time with all their strength.
But in spite of this determination again they fell
asleep. At dawn the prince awoke and saw that the
princess was gone.</p>

<p>He jumped up and shook Keen by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Keen, wake up! Where is the princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keen rubbed his eyes, took one look out of the
window, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I see her. Two hundred miles from here
is a mountain, in the mountain is a rock, in the rock a
precious stone. That stone is the princess. If Longshanks
will carry me over there we&rsquo;ll get her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Longshanks put Keen on his shoulder, stretched
himself out until he was able to go twenty miles at a
stride, and off he went. Keen fixed his glowing eyes
on the mountain and the mountain crumbled. Then
the rock that was inside the mountain broke into a
thousand pieces and there was the precious stone glittering
among the pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
They picked it up and carried it back to the prince.
As soon as he dropped it on the floor the princess reappeared.</p>

<p>When the magician came in and found her there, his
eyes sparkled with anger, and bang! the second of his
iron bands cracked and burst asunder. Rumbling and
growling he led the princess away.</p>

<p>That day passed as the day before. After supper
the magician brought back the princess and, looking
fiercely at the prince, he sneered and said: &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;ll see who wins, you or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This night the prince and his men tried harder than
ever to stay awake. They didn&rsquo;t even allow themselves
to sit down but kept walking. All in vain. One after
another they fell asleep on their feet and again the
princess escaped.</p>

<p>In the morning the prince, as usual, was the first to
awake. When he saw the princess was gone, he
aroused Keen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Keen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look out and tell
me where the princess is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Keen had to look long before he saw her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, she is far away. Three hundred miles
from here there is a black sea. At the bottom of that
sea is a shell. In that shell is a golden ring. That ring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
is the princess. But don&rsquo;t be worried, master, we&rsquo;ll
get her. This time let Longshanks take Girth as well
as me, for we may need him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Longshanks put Keen on one shoulder and
Girth on the other. Then he stretched himself out
until he was able to cover thirty miles at a stride.
When they reached the black sea Keen showed Longshanks
where to reach down in the water for the
shell. Longshanks reached down as far as he could
but not far enough to touch bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, comrades, wait a bit,&rdquo; said Girth. &ldquo;Now
it&rsquo;s my turn to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he puffed himself out and out as far as
he could. Then he lay down on the beach and began
drinking up the sea. He drank it in such great gulps
that soon Longshanks was able to reach bottom and
to get the shell. Longshanks took out the ring and
then, putting his comrades on his shoulders, started
back for the castle. He was not able to go fast, for
Girth, with half the sea in his stomach, was very heavy.
At last in desperation Longshanks turned Girth upside
down and shook him and instantly the great plain
upon which he emptied him turned into a huge lake.
It was all poor Girth could do to scramble out of the
water and back to Longshanks&rsquo; shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
Meanwhile at the castle the prince was awaiting
his men in great anxiety. Morning was breaking
and still they did not come. As the first rays of the
sun shot over the mountain tops the doors slammed
open and the magician stood on the threshold. He
glanced around and when he saw that the princess was
not there he gave a mocking laugh and entered.</p>

<p>But at that very instant there was the crash of a
breaking window, a golden ring struck the floor, and
lo! the princess! Keen had seen in time the danger
that was threatening the prince and Longshanks had
hurled the ring through the window.</p>

<p>The magician bellowed with rage until the castle
shook and then, bang! the third iron band burst
asunder and from what had once been the magician a
black crow arose and flew out of the broken window
and was never seen again.</p>

<p>Instantly the beautiful princess blushed like a rose
and was able to speak and to thank the prince for
delivering her.</p>

<p>Everything in the castle came to life. The prince
with the uplifted sword finished his stroke and put the
sword into its scabbard. The knight who was stumbling
fell and jumped up holding his nose to see
whether he still had it. The serving man under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
chimney put the meat into his mouth and kept on
eating. And so every one finished what he had been
doing at the moment of enchantment. The horses,
too, came to life and stamped and neighed.</p>

<p>Around the castle the trees burst into leaf. Flowers
covered the meadows. High in the heavens the
lark sang, and in the flowing river there were shoals
of tiny fish. Everything was alive again, everything
happy.</p>

<p>The knights who had been restored to life gathered
in the hall to thank the prince for their deliverance.
But the prince said to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to thank me for. If it had not
been for these, my three trusty servants, Longshanks,
Girth, and Keen, I should have met the same fate
as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince set out at once on his journey home
with his bride and his three serving men. When he
reached home the old king, who had given him up for
lost, wept for joy at his unexpected return.</p>

<p>All the knights whom the prince had rescued were
invited to the wedding which took place at once and
lasted for three weeks.</p>

<p>When it was over, Longshanks, Girth, and Keen
presented themselves to the young king and told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
that they were again going out into the world to
look for work. The young king urged them to stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you everything you need as long as
you live,&rdquo; he promised them, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t have
to exert yourselves at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But such an idle life was not to their liking. So
they took their leave and started out again and to
this day they are still knocking around somewhere.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a king who took great delight
in hunting. One day he followed a stag a great
distance into the forest. He went on and on until
he lost his way. Night fell and the king by happy
chance came upon a clearing where a charcoal-burner
had a cottage. The king asked the charcoal-burner
to lead him out of the forest and offered to pay him
handsomely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to go with you,&rdquo; the charcoal-burner
said, &ldquo;but my wife is expecting the birth of a child and
I cannot leave her. It is too late for you to start out
alone. Won&rsquo;t you spend the night here? Lie down on
some hay in the garret and tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be your
guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king had to accept this arrangement. He
climbed into the garret and lay down on the floor.
Soon afterwards a son was born to the charcoal-burner.</p>

<p>At midnight the king noticed a strange light in
the room below him. He peeped through a chink in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
the boards and saw the charcoal-burner asleep, his wife
lying in a dead faint, and three old women, all in
white, standing over the baby, each holding a lighted
taper in her hand.</p>

<p>The first old woman said: &ldquo;My gift to this boy is
that he shall encounter great dangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second said: &ldquo;My gift to him is that he shall
go safely through them all, and live long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third one said: &ldquo;And I give him for wife the
baby daughter born this night to the king who lies
upstairs on the straw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three old women blew out their tapers and
all was quiet. They were the Fates.</p>

<p>The king felt as though a sword had been thrust
into his heart. He lay awake till morning trying to
think out some plan by which he could thwart the
will of the three old Fates.</p>

<p>When day broke the child began to cry and the
charcoal-burner woke up. Then he saw that his wife
had died during the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor motherless child,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what
shall I do with you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the baby,&rdquo; the king said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that
he&rsquo;s looked after properly and I&rsquo;ll give you enough
money to keep you the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
The charcoal-burner was delighted with this offer
and the king went away promising to send at once for
the baby.</p>

<p>A few days later when he reached his palace he
was met with the joyful news that a beautiful little
baby daughter had been born to him. He asked the
time of her birth, and of course it was on the very
night when he saw the Fates. Instead of being pleased
at the safe arrival of the baby princess, the king
frowned.</p>

<p>Then he called one of his stewards and said to him:
&ldquo;Go into the forest in a direction that I shall tell
you. You will find there a cottage where a charcoal-burner
lives. Give him this money and get from him
a little child. Take the child and on your way back
drown it. Do as I say or I shall have you drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steward went, found the charcoal-burner, and
took the child. He put it into a basket and carried
it away. As he was crossing a broad river he dropped
the basket into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodnight to you, little son-in-law that nobody
wanted!&rdquo; the king said when he heard what the
steward had done.</p>

<p>He supposed of course that the baby was drowned.
But it wasn&rsquo;t. Its little basket floated in the water like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
a cradle, and the baby slept as if the river were singing
it a lullaby. It floated down with the current past
a fisherman&rsquo;s cottage. The fisherman saw it, got into
his boat, and went after it. When he found what the
basket contained he was overjoyed. At once he carried
the baby to his wife and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have always wanted a little son and here
you have one. The river has given him to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fisherman&rsquo;s wife was delighted and brought
up the child as her own. They named him Plavachek,
which means a little boy who has come floating on the
water.</p>

<p>The river flowed on and the days went by and
Plavachek grew from a baby to a boy and then into
a handsome youth, the handsomest by far in the whole
countryside.</p>

<p>One day the king happened to ride that way unattended.
It was hot and he was thirsty. He beckoned
to the fisherman to get him a drink of fresh
water. Plavachek brought it to him. The king looked
at the handsome youth in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a fine lad,&rdquo; he said to the fisherman.
&ldquo;Is he your own son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, yet he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the fisherman answered.
&ldquo;Just twenty years ago a little baby in a basket floated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
down the river. We took him in and he has been
ours ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mist rose before the king&rsquo;s eyes and he went
deathly pale, for he knew at once that Plavachek was
the child that he had ordered drowned.</p>

<p>Soon he recovered himself and jumping from his
horse he said: &ldquo;I need a messenger to send to my
palace and I have no one with me. Could this youth
go for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty has but to command,&rdquo; the fisherman
said, &ldquo;and Plavachek will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king sat down and wrote a letter to the queen.
This is what he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the young man who delivers this letter run
through with a sword at once. He is a dangerous
enemy. Let him be dispatched before I return. Such
is my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He folded the letter, made it secure, and sealed it
with his own signet.</p>

<p>Plavachek took the letter and started out with it at
once. He had to go through a deep forest where he
missed the path and lost his way. He struggled on
through underbrush and thicket until it began to
grow dark. Then he met an old woman who said to
him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where are you going, Plavachek?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m carrying this letter to the king&rsquo;s palace and
I&rsquo;ve lost my way. Can you put me on the right road,
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get there today,&rdquo; the old woman said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark now. Spend the night with me. You
won&rsquo;t be with a stranger, for I&rsquo;m your old godmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek allowed himself to be persuaded and
presently he saw before him a pretty little house that
seemed at that moment to have sprung out of the
ground.</p>

<p>During the night while Plavachek was asleep, the
old woman took the letter out of his pocket and put in
another that read as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the young man who delivers this letter married
to our daughter at once. He is my destined son-in-law.
Let the wedding take place before I return.
Such is my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Plavachek delivered the letter and as
soon as the queen read it, she gave orders at once for
the wedding. Both she and her daughter were much
taken with the handsome youth and gazed at him with
tender eyes. As for Plavachek he fell instantly in love
with the princess and was delighted to marry her.</p>

<p>Some days after the wedding the king returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
and when he heard what had happened he flew into a
violent rage at the queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested the queen, &ldquo;you yourself ordered
me to have him married to our daughter before you
came back. Here is your letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king took the letter and examined it carefully.
The handwriting, the seal, the paper&mdash;all were
his own.</p>

<p>He called his son-in-law and questioned him.</p>

<p>Plavachek related how he had lost his way in the
forest and spent the night with his godmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does your godmother look like?&rdquo; the king
asked.</p>

<p>Plavachek described her.</p>

<p>From the description the king recognized her as
the same old woman who had promised the princess
to the charcoal-burner&rsquo;s son twenty years before.</p>

<p>He looked at Plavachek thoughtfully and at last
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone. However, young
man, you can&rsquo;t expect to be my son-in-law for nothing.
If you want my daughter you must bring me
for dowry three of the golden hairs of old Grandfather
Knowitall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought to himself that this would be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
impossible task and so would be a good way to get rid of
an undesirable son-in-law.</p>

<p>Plavachek took leave of his bride and started off.
He didn&rsquo;t know which way to go. Who would know?
Everybody talked about old Grandfather Knowitall,
but nobody seemed to know where to find him. Yet
Plavachek had a Fate for a godmother, so it wasn&rsquo;t
likely that he would miss the right road.</p>

<p>He traveled long and far, going over wooded hills
and desert plains and crossing deep rivers. He came
at last to a black sea.</p>

<p>There he saw a boat and an old ferryman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, old ferryman!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God grant that prayer, young traveler!
Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get
three of his golden hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho! I have long been hunting for just such
a messenger as you! For twenty years I have been
ferrying people across this black sea and nobody has
come to relieve me. If you promise to ask Grandfather
Knowitall when my work will end, I&rsquo;ll ferry
you over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek promised and the boatman took him
across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Plavachek traveled on until he came to a great city
that was in a state of decay. Before the city he met
an old man who had a staff in his hand, but even with
the staff he could scarcely crawl along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, old grandfather!&rdquo; Plavachek
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God grant that prayer, handsome youth!
Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get
three of his golden hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! We have been waiting a long time for
just such a messenger as you! I must lead you at
once to the king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took him to the king and the king said:
&ldquo;Ah, so you are going on an errand to Grandfather
Knowitall! We have an apple-tree here that used
to bear apples of youth. If any one ate one of those
apples, no matter how aged he was, he&rsquo;d become young
again. But, alas, for twenty years now our tree has
borne no fruit. If you promise to ask Grandfather
Knowitall if there is any help for us, I will reward
you handsomely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek gave the king his promise and the king
bid him godspeed.</p>

<p>Plavachek traveled on until he reached another great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
city that was half in ruins. Not far from the city
a man was burying his father, and tears as big as
peas were rolling down his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, mournful grave-digger!&rdquo; Plavachek
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God grant that prayer, kind traveler!
Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to old Grandfather Knowitall to get
three of his golden hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Grandfather Knowitall! What a pity you
didn&rsquo;t come sooner! Our king has long been waiting
for just such a messenger as you! I must lead you
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took Plavachek to the king and the king
said to him: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going on an errand to Grandfather
Knowitall. We have a well here that used to
flow with the water of life. If any one drank of it,
no matter how sick he was, he would get well. Nay,
if he were already dead, this water, sprinkled upon
him, would bring him back to life. But, alas, for
twenty years now the well has gone dry. If you
promise to ask Grandfather Knowitall if there is help
for us, I will reward you handsomely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek gave the king his promise and the king
bid him godspeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
After that Plavachek traveled long and far into a
black forest. Deep in the forest he came upon a broad
green meadow full of beautiful flowers and in its
midst a golden palace glittering as though it were on
fire. This was the palace of Grandfather Knowitall.</p>

<p>Plavachek entered and found nobody there but an
old woman who sat spinning in a corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Plavachek,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am delighted
to see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the old woman and saw that she was
his godmother with whom he had spent the night when
he was carrying the letter to the palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has brought you here, Plavachek?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king, godmother. He says I can&rsquo;t be his son-in-law
for nothing. I have to give a dowry. So he
has sent me to old Grandfather Knowitall to get three
of his golden hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman smiled and said: &ldquo;Do you know
who Grandfather Knowitall is? Why, he&rsquo;s the bright
Sun who goes everywhere and sees everything. I am
his mother. In the morning he&rsquo;s a little lad, at noon
he&rsquo;s a grown man, and in the evening an old grandfather.
I will get you three of the golden hairs from
his golden head, for I must not be a godmother for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
nothing! But, my lad, you mustn&rsquo;t remain where you
are. My son is kind, but if he comes home hungry
he might want to roast you and eat you for his supper.
There&rsquo;s an empty tub over there and I&rsquo;ll just
cover you with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek begged his godmother to get from
Grandfather Knowitall the answers for the three questions
he had promised to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;and do you listen
carefully to what he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was the rushing sound of a mighty
wind outside and the Sun, an old grandfather with a
golden head, flew in by the western window. He
sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew! Phew!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I smell human flesh!
Have you any one here, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Star of the day, whom could I have here without
your seeing him? The truth is you&rsquo;ve been flying all
day long over God&rsquo;s world and your nose is filled
with the smell of human flesh. That&rsquo;s why you still
smell it when you come home in the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man said nothing more and sat down to
his supper.</p>

<p>After supper he laid his head on the old woman&rsquo;s
lap and fell sound asleep. The old woman pulled out a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
golden hair and threw it on the floor. It twanged like
the string of a violin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother?&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my boy, nothing. I was asleep and had
a wonderful dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you dream about, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamt about a city where they had a well of
living water. If any one drank of it, no matter how
sick he was, he would get well. Nay, if he were
already dead, this water, sprinkled on him, would
bring him back to life. For the last twenty years the
well has gone dry. Is there anything to be done to
make it flow again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s a frog sitting on the spring that
feeds the well. Let them kill the frog and clean out
the well and the water will flow as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he fell asleep again the old woman pulled
out another golden hair and threw it on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my boy, nothing. I was asleep again
and I had a wonderful dream. I dreamt of a city
where they had an apple-tree that bore apples of
youth. If any one ate one of those apples, no matter
how aged he was, he&rsquo;d become young again. But for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
twenty years the tree has borne no fruit. Can anything
be done about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. In the roots of the tree there is a snake
that takes its strength. Let them kill the snake and
transplant the tree. Then it will bear fruit as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell asleep again and the old woman pulled out
a third golden hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you let me sleep, mother?&rdquo; he complained,
and started to sit up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie still, my boy, lie still. I didn&rsquo;t intend to
wake you, but a heavy sleep fell upon me and I had
another wonderful dream. I dreamt of a boatman on
the black sea. For twenty years he has been ferrying
that boat and no one has offered to relieve him.
When will he be relieved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that boatman is the son of a stupid
mother! Why doesn&rsquo;t he thrust the oar into the hand
of some one else and jump ashore himself? Then
the other man would have to be ferryman in his place.
But now let me be quiet. I must get up early
tomorrow morning and go and dry the tears which the
king&rsquo;s daughter sheds every night for her husband, the
charcoal-burner&rsquo;s son, whom the king has sent to get
three of my golden hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning there was again the rushing sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
of a mighty wind outside and a beautiful golden child&mdash;no
longer an old man&mdash;awoke on his mother&rsquo;s lap.
It was the glorious Sun. He bade his mother farewell
and flew out by an eastern window.</p>

<p>The old woman turned over the tub and said to
Plavachek: &ldquo;Here are the three golden hairs for you.
You also have Grandfather Knowitall&rsquo;s answers to
your three questions. Now good-by. As you will
need me no more, you will never see me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek thanked his godmother most gratefully
and departed.</p>

<p>When he reached the first city the king asked him
what news he brought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; Plavachek said. &ldquo;Have the well
cleaned out and kill the frog that sits on its spring.
If you do this the water will flow again as it used to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king ordered this to be done at once and when
he saw the water beginning to bubble up and flow
again, he made Plavachek a present of twelve horses,
white as swans, laden with as much gold and silver
as they could carry.</p>

<p>When Plavachek came to the second city and the
king of that city asked him what news he brought,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good news! Have the apple tree dug up. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
its roots you will find a snake. Kill the snake and
replant the tree. Then it will bear fruit as it used to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king had this done at once and during the
night the tree burst into bloom and bore great quantities
of fruit. The king was delighted and made
Plavachek a present of twelve horses, black as ravens,
laden with as much riches as they could carry.</p>

<p>Plavachek traveled on and when he came to the
black sea, the boatman asked him had he the answer to
his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; said Plavachek, &ldquo;but you must
ferry me over before I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boatman wanted to hear the answer at once,
but Plavachek was firm. So the old man ferried him
across with his twelve white horses and his twelve
black horses.</p>

<p>When Plavachek was safely landed, he said: &ldquo;The
next person who comes to be ferried over, thrust the
oar into his hand and do you jump ashore. Then the
other man will have to be boatman in your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plavachek traveled home to the palace. The king
could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the three
golden hairs of Grandfather Knowitall. The princess
wept again, not for sorrow this time but for joy at
her bridegroom&rsquo;s return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
&ldquo;But, Plavachek,&rdquo; the king gasped, &ldquo;where did
you get these beautiful horses and all these riches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I earned them,&rdquo; said Plavachek proudly. Then
he related how he helped one king who had a tree of
the apples of youth and another king who had a well
of the water of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apples of youth! Water of life!&rdquo; the king kept
repeating softly to himself. &ldquo;If I ate one of those
apples I should become young again! If I were dead
the water of life would restore me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lost no time in starting out in quest of the
apples of youth and the water of life. And do you
know, he hasn&rsquo;t come back yet!</p>

<p>So Plavachek, the charcoal-burner&rsquo;s son, became the
king&rsquo;s son-in-law as the old Fate foretold.</p>

<p>As for the king, well, I fear he&rsquo;s still ferrying that
boat across the black sea!</p>

<h2>THE FLAMING HORSE</h2>

<p class="center">THE STORY OF A COUNTRY WHERE THE SUN
NEVER SHINES</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span></p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE FLAMING HORSE</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a land that was dreary and dark
as the grave, for the sun of heaven never shone
upon it. The king of the country had a wonderful
horse that had, growing right on his forehead, a flaming
sun. In order that his subjects might have the light
that is necessary for life, the king had this horse led
back and forth from one end of his dark kingdom to
the other. Wherever he went his flaming head shone
out and it seemed like beautiful day.</p>

<p>Suddenly this wonderful horse disappeared. Heavy
darkness that nothing could dispel settled down on
the country. Fear spread among the people and soon
they were suffering terrible poverty, for they were unable
to cultivate the fields or do anything else that
would earn them a livelihood. Confusion increased
until the king saw that the whole country was likely
to perish. In order then, if possible, to save his people,
he gathered his army together and set out in search
of the missing horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
Through heavy darkness they groped their way
slowly and with difficulty to the far boundaries of the
kingdom. At last they reached the ancient forests that
bordered the neighboring state and they saw gleaming
through the trees faint rays of the sunshine with which
that kingdom was blessed.</p>

<p>Here they came upon a small lonely cottage which
the king entered in order to find out where he was and
to ask directions for moving forward.</p>

<p>A man was sitting at the table reading diligently
from a large open book. When the king bowed to
him, he raised his eyes, returned the greeting, and stood
up. His whole appearance showed that he was no
ordinary man but a seer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just reading about you,&rdquo; he said to the king,
&ldquo;that you were gone in search of the flaming horse. Exert
yourself no further, for you will never find him. But
trust the enterprise to me and I will get him for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do that, my man,&rdquo; the king said, &ldquo;I will
pay you royally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seek no reward. Return home at once with your
army, for your people need you. Only leave here with
me one of your serving men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king did exactly as the seer advised and went
home at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
The next day the seer and his man set forth. They
journeyed far and long until they had crossed six different
countries. Then they went on into the seventh
country which was ruled over by three brothers who
had married three sisters, the daughters of a
witch.</p>

<p>They made their way to the front of the royal
palace, where the seer said to his man: &ldquo;Do you stay
here while I go in and find out whether the kings are
at home. It is they who stole the flaming horse and
the youngest brother rides him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the seer transformed himself into a green bird
and flew up to the window of the eldest queen and
flitted about and pecked until she opened the window
and let him into her chamber. When she let him in, he
alighted on her white hand and the queen was as happy
as a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pretty thing!&rdquo; she said, playing with him.
&ldquo;If my husband were home how pleased he would be!
But he&rsquo;s off visiting a third of his kingdom and he
won&rsquo;t be home until evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the old witch came into the room and as
soon as she saw the bird she shrieked to her daughter:
&ldquo;Wring the neck of that cursed bird, or it will stain
you with blood!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why should it stain me with blood, the dear innocent
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear innocent mischief!&rdquo; shrieked the witch.
&ldquo;Here, give it to me and I&rsquo;ll wring its neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to catch the bird, but the bird changed
itself into a man and was already out of the door before
they knew what had become of him.</p>

<p>After that he changed himself again into a green
bird and flew up to the window of the second sister.
He pecked at it until she opened it and let him in.
Then he flitted about her, settling first on one of her
white hands, then on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dear bird you are!&rdquo; cried the queen.
&ldquo;How you would please my husband if he were at
home. But he&rsquo;s off visiting two-thirds of his kingdom
and he won&rsquo;t be back until tomorrow evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the witch ran into the room and
as soon as she saw the bird she shrieked out: &ldquo;Wring
the neck of that wretched bird, or it will stain you with
blood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should it stain me with blood?&rdquo; the daughter
answered. &ldquo;The dear innocent thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear innocent mischief!&rdquo; shrieked the witch.
&ldquo;Here, give it to me and I&rsquo;ll wring its neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached out to catch the bird, but in less time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
than it takes to clap a hand, the bird had changed itself
into a man who ran through the door and was gone
before they knew where he was.</p>

<p>A moment later he again changed himself into a
green bird and flew up to the window of the youngest
queen. He flitted about and pecked until she opened
the window and let him in. Then he alighted at once
on her white hand and this pleased her so much that
she laughed like a child and played with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a dear bird you are!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How
you would delight my husband if he were home. But
he&rsquo;s off visiting all three parts of his kingdom and he
won&rsquo;t be back until the day after tomorrow in the
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the old witch rushed into the room.
&ldquo;Wring the neck of that cursed bird!&rdquo; she shrieked,
&ldquo;or it will stain you with blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; the queen answered, &ldquo;why
should it stain me with blood&mdash;beautiful innocent creature
that it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful innocent mischief!&rdquo; shrieked the witch.
&ldquo;Here, give it to me and I&rsquo;ll wring its neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that moment the bird changed itself into a
man, disappeared through the door, and they never saw
him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
The seer knew now where the kings were and when
they would come home. So he made his plans accordingly.
He ordered his servant to follow him and they
set out from the city at a quick pace. They went on
until they came to a bridge which the three kings as
they came back would have to cross.</p>

<p>The seer and his man hid themselves under the
bridge and lay there in wait until evening. As the
sun sank behind the mountains, they heard the clatter
of hoofs approaching the bridge. It was the eldest
king returning home. At the bridge his horse stumbled
on a log which the seer had rolled there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What scoundrel has thrown a log here?&rdquo; cried
the king angrily.</p>

<p>Instantly the seer leaped out from under the bridge
and demanded of the king how he dared to call him a
scoundrel. Clamoring for satisfaction he drew his
sword and attacked the king. The king, too, drew
sword and defended himself, but after a short struggle
he fell from his horse dead. The seer bound the dead
king to his horse and then with a cut of the whip
started the horse homewards.</p>

<p>The seer hid himself again and he and his man lay
in wait until the next evening.</p>

<p>On that evening near sunset the second king came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
riding up to the bridge. When he saw the ground
sprinkled with blood, he cried out: &ldquo;Surely there has
been a murder here! Who has dared to commit such
a crime in my kingdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words the seer leaped out from under
the bridge, drew his sword, and shouted: &ldquo;How
dare you insult me? Defend yourself as best you
can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king drew, but after a short struggle he, too,
yielded up his life to the sword of the seer.</p>

<p>The seer bound the dead king to his horse and with
a cut of the whip started the horse homewards.</p>

<p>Then the seer hid himself again under the bridge
and he and his man lay there in wait until the third
evening.</p>

<p>On the third evening just at sunset the youngest
king came galloping home on the flaming steed. He
was hurrying fast because he had been delayed. But
when he saw red blood at the bridge he stopped short
and looked around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What audacious villain,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;has dared to
kill a man in my kingdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when the seer stood before
him with drawn sword demanding satisfaction for the
insult of his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve insulted you,&rdquo; the king
said, &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;re the murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the seer refused to parley, the king, too, drew
his sword and defended himself.</p>

<p>To overcome the first two kings had been mere play
for the seer, but it was no play this time. They both
fought until their swords were broken and still victory
was doubtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall accomplish nothing with swords,&rdquo; the
seer said. &ldquo;That is plain. I tell you what: let us turn
ourselves into wheels and start rolling down the hill and
the wheel that gets broken let him yield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a cartwheel and
you be a lighter wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the seer answered quickly. &ldquo;You be the
light wheel and I&rsquo;ll be the cartwheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this the king agreed. So they went up the hill,
turned themselves into wheels and started rolling down.
The cartwheel went whizzing into the lighter wheel and
broke its spokes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the seer, rising up from the cartwheel.
&ldquo;I am victor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, brother, not so!&rdquo; said the king, standing
before the seer. &ldquo;You only broke my fingers! Now I
tell you what: let us change ourselves into two flames
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
and let the flame that burns up the other be victor.
I&rsquo;ll be a red flame and do you be a white one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; the seer interrupted. &ldquo;You be the white
flame and I&rsquo;ll be the red one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king agreed to this. So they went back to the
road that led to the bridge, turned themselves into
flames, and began burning each other mercilessly. But
neither was able to burn up the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly a beggar came down the road, an old man
with a long gray beard and a bald head, with a scrip
at his side and a heavy staff in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the white flame said, &ldquo;get some water
and pour it on the red flame and I&rsquo;ll give you a penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the red flame called out quickly: &ldquo;Not so,
father! Get some water and pour it on the white flame
and I&rsquo;ll give you a shilling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now of course the shilling appealed to the beggar
more than the penny. So he got some water, poured
it on the white flame and that was the end of the king.</p>

<p>The red flame turned into a man who seized the
flaming horse by the bridle, mounted him and, after he
had rewarded the beggar, called his servant and rode
off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the royal palace there was deep
sorrow for the murdered kings. The halls were draped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
in black and people came from miles around to gaze at
the mutilated bodies of the two elder brothers which the
horses had carried home.</p>

<p>The old witch was beside herself with rage. As
soon as she had devised a plan whereby she could
avenge the murder of her sons-in-law, she took her three
daughters under her arm, mounted an iron rake, and
sailed off through the air.</p>

<p>The seer and his man had already covered a good
part of their journey and were hurrying on over rough
mountains and across desert plains, when the servant
was taken with a terrible hunger. There wasn&rsquo;t anything
in sight that he could eat, not even a wild berry.
Then suddenly they came upon an apple tree that was
bending beneath a load of ripe fruit. The apples were
red and pleasant to the sight and sent out a fragrance
that was most inviting.</p>

<p>The servant was delighted. &ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Now I can feast to my heart&rsquo;s content on
these apples!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was already running to the tree when the seer
called him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t touch them! I will pick them for
you myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But instead of picking an apple, the seer drew his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
sword and struck a mighty blow into the apple tree.
Red blood gushed forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just see, my man! You would have perished if
you had eaten one apple. This apple tree is the eldest
queen, whom her mother, the witch, placed here for our
destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently they came to a spring. Its water bubbled
up clear as crystal and most tempting to the tired
traveler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;since we can get nothing
better, at least we can take a drink of this good water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried the seer. &ldquo;I will draw some for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But instead of drawing water he plunged his
naked sword into the middle of the spring. Instantly
it was covered with blood and blood began to spurt
from the spring in thick streams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the second queen, whom her mother, the
witch, placed here to work our doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently they came to a rosebush covered with
beautiful red roses that scented all the air with their
fragrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What beautiful roses!&rdquo; said the servant. &ldquo;I have
never seen any such in all my life. I&rsquo;ll go pluck a few.
As I can&rsquo;t eat or drink, I&rsquo;ll comfort myself with roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to pluck them!&rdquo; cried the seer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
pluck them for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he cut into the bush with his sword and
red blood spurted out as though he had cut a human
vein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the youngest queen,&rdquo; said the seer, &ldquo;whom
her mother, the witch, placed here in the hope of revenging
herself on us for the death of her sons-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that they proceeded without further adventures.</p>

<p>When they crossed the boundaries of the dark kingdom,
the sun in the horse&rsquo;s forehead sent out its blessed
rays in all directions. Everything came to life. The
earth rejoiced and covered itself with flowers.</p>

<p>The king felt he could never thank the seer enough
and he offered him the half of his kingdom.</p>

<p>But the seer replied: &ldquo;You are the king. Keep on
ruling over the whole of your kingdom and let me
return to my cottage in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bade the king farewell and departed.</p>

<p class="center">THE STORY OF A PRINCE
WHO CLIMBED THE GLASS HILL</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE THREE CITRONS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was an aged king who
had an only son. One day he called the prince
to him and said: &ldquo;My son, you see that my head is
white. Soon I shall be closing my eyes and you are
not yet settled in life. Marry, my son, marry at once
so that I can bless you before I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince made no answer but he took the king&rsquo;s
words to heart and pondered them. He would gladly
have done as his father wished but there was no young
girl upon whom his affections were set.</p>

<p>One day when he was sitting in the garden, wondering
what to do, an old woman suddenly appeared before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to the top of the Glass Hill,
pluck the Three Citrons, and you will get a wife in
whom your heart will delight.&rdquo; With that she disappeared
as mysteriously as she had come.</p>

<p>Her words went through the prince&rsquo;s soul like a
bright dart. Instantly he determined, come what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
might, to find the Glass Hill and to pluck the Three
Citrons. He told his father his intention and the old
king fitted him out for the journey and gave him his
blessing.</p>

<p>For a long time the prince wandered over wooded
mountains and desert plains without seeing or even
hearing anything of the Glass Hill and the Three
Citrons. One day, worn out with his long journey, he
threw himself down in the shade of a wide-spreading
linden tree. As his father&rsquo;s sword, which he wore at
his side, clanked on the ground, twelve ravens began
cawing from the top of the tree. Frightened by the
clanking of the sword, they raised their wings and flew
off.</p>

<p>The prince jumped to his feet. &ldquo;Those are the first
living creatures I have seen for many a day. I&rsquo;ll go
in the direction they have taken,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;and perhaps I&rsquo;ll have better luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he traveled on and after three days and three
nights a high castle came in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pushing joyfully
ahead. &ldquo;I shall soon have human companionship once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The castle was built entirely of lead. The twelve
ravens circled above it and in front of it stood an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
woman leaning on a long leaden staff. She was a
Yezibaba. Now you must know that a Yezibaba is
an ugly old witch with a hooked nose, a bristly face,
and long scrawny hands. She&rsquo;s a bad old thing usually,
but sometimes, if you take her fancy, she&rsquo;s kind.</p>

<p>This time when she looked the prince over she shook
her head at him in a friendly way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yi, yi, my boy, how did you get here? Why, not
even a little bird or a tiny butterfly comes here, much
less a human being! You&rsquo;d better escape if life is dear
to you, or my son, when he comes home, will eat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, old mother, don&rsquo;t make me go,&rdquo; begged
the prince. &ldquo;I have come to you for advice to know
whether you can tell me anything about the Glass Hill
and the Three Citrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have never heard a word about the Glass
Hill,&rdquo; Yezibaba said. &ldquo;But wait until my son comes.
He may be able to tell you something. Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll
manage to save you somehow. Go hide under the
besom and stay there until I call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mountains rumbled and the castle trembled and
Yezibaba whispered to the prince that her son was
coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew! Phew! I smell human meat! I&rsquo;ll eat
it!&rdquo; shouted Yezibaba&rsquo;s son while he was still in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
doorway. He struck the ground with his leaden club
and the whole castle shook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my son, don&rsquo;t talk that way. It&rsquo;s true
there is a pretty youth here, but he&rsquo;s come to ask you
about something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he wants to ask me something, let him
come out and ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, he will, but only when you promise
me that you will do nothing to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t do anything to him. Now let him
come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince hidden under the besom was shaking
like an aspen leaf, for when he peeped through the twigs
he saw an ogre so huge that he himself would reach up
only to his knees. Happily the ogre had guaranteed
his life before Yezibaba ordered him out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, you little June bug!&rdquo; shouted
the ogre. &ldquo;What are you afraid of? Where have you
been? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I want?&rdquo; repeated the prince. &ldquo;I have
been wandering in these mountains a long time and I
can&rsquo;t find what I&rsquo;m seeking. So I&rsquo;ve come to you to
ask whether you can tell me something about the Glass
Hill and the Three Citrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yezibaba&rsquo;s son wrinkled his forehead. He thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
for a moment and then, lowering his voice a little, he
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of any Glass Hill around here.
But I tell you what you do: go on to my brother in
arms who lives in the Silver Castle and ask him.
Maybe he&rsquo;ll be able to tell you. But I can&rsquo;t let you go
away hungry. That would never do! Hi, mother,
bring out the dumplings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Yezibaba placed a large dish on the table and
her giant son sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come on! Eat!&rdquo; he shouted to the prince.</p>

<p>When the prince took the first dumpling and bit
into it, he almost broke two of his teeth, for the dumpling
was made of lead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; shouted Yezibaba&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
eat? Doesn&rsquo;t the dumpling taste good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very good,&rdquo; said the prince, politely, &ldquo;but
just now I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not hungry now you will be later.
Put a few in your pocket and eat them on your
journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, whether he wanted them or not, the prince had
to put some leaden dumplings into his pocket. Then
he took his leave of Yezibaba and her son and
traveled on.</p>

<p>He went on and on for three days and three nights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
The farther he went, the more inhospitable became the
country. Before him stretched a waste of mountains,
behind him a waste of mountains with no living creature
in sight.</p>

<p>Wearied with his long journey, he threw himself on
the ground. His silver sword clanked sharply and at
its sound twenty-four ravens circled above him, cawed
in fright, and flew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good sign!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow the
ravens again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So on he went as fast as his legs could carry him
until he came in sight of a tall castle. It was still
far away, but even at that distance it shone and flashed,
for it was built of pure silver.</p>

<p>In front of the castle stood an old woman, bent
with age, and leaning on a long silver staff. This was
the second Yezibaba.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yi, yi, my boy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How did you get
here? Why, not even a little bird or a tiny butterfly
comes here, much less a human being. You&rsquo;d better
escape if life is dear to you, or my son, when he comes
home, will eat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, old mother, he won&rsquo;t eat me. I bring
greetings from his brother of the Leaden Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you bring greetings from the Leaden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
Castle you are safe enough. Come in, my boy, and
tell me your business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My business? For a long time, old mother, I&rsquo;ve
been looking for the Glass Hill and the Three Citrons,
but I can&rsquo;t find them. So I&rsquo;ve come to ask you whether
you could tell me something about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my boy, I don&rsquo;t know anything about the
Glass Hill. But wait until my son comes. Perhaps
he can help you. In the meantime hide yourself under
the bed and don&rsquo;t come out until I call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mountains rumbled and the castle trembled and
the prince knew that Yezibaba&rsquo;s son was coming home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew! Phew! I smell human meat! I&rsquo;ll eat
it!&rdquo; bellowed the mighty fellow. He stood in the doorway
and banged the ground with his silver club until
the whole castle shook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my son,&rdquo; said Yezibaba, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk that
way! A pretty little chap has come bringing you
greetings from your brother of the Leaden Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he&rsquo;s been at the Leaden Castle and came
to no harm, he&rsquo;ll have nothing to fear from me either.
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince slipped out from under the bed and
stood before the ogre. Looking up at him was like
looking at the top of the tallest pine tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, little June bug, so you&rsquo;ve been at my
brother&rsquo;s, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;See, I still have the
dumplings he gave me for the journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you. Well, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I want? I came to ask you whether you
could tell me something about the Glass Hill and the
Three Citrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, it seems to me I used to hear something
about them, but I forget. I tell you what you do:
go to my brother of the Golden Castle and ask him.
But wait! I can&rsquo;t let you go away hungry. Hi,
mother, bring out the dumplings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yezibaba brought the dumplings on a large silver
dish and put them on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; shouted her son.</p>

<p>The prince saw they were silver dumplings, so he
said he wasn&rsquo;t hungry just then, but he&rsquo;d like to take
some with him for the journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take as many as you want,&rdquo; shouted the ogre.
&ldquo;And give my greetings to my brother and my aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the prince took some silver dumplings, made
suitable thanks, and departed.</p>

<p>He journeyed on from the Silver Castle three days
and three nights, through dense forests and over rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
mountains, not knowing where he was nor which way
to turn. At last all worn out he threw himself down
in the shade of a beech tree to rest. As the sword
clanked on the ground, its silver voice rang out and a
flock of thirty-six ravens circled over his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caw! Caw!&rdquo; they croaked. Then, frightened by
the sound of the sword, they flew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Praise God!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;The Golden
Castle can&rsquo;t be far!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jumped up and started eagerly off in the direction
the ravens had taken. As he left a valley and
climbed a little hill he saw before him a beautiful wide
meadow in the midst of which stood the Golden Castle
shining like the sun. Before the gate of the castle stood
a bent old Yezibaba leaning on a golden staff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yi, yi, my boy,&rdquo; she cried to the prince, &ldquo;how did
you get here? Why, not even a little bird or a tiny
butterfly comes here, much less a human being! You&rsquo;d
better escape if life is dear to you, or my son, when
he comes home, will eat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, old mother, he won&rsquo;t eat me, for I bring
him greetings from his brother of the Silver Castle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you bring greetings from the Silver
Castle you are safe enough. Come in, my boy, and
tell me your business.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
&ldquo;My business, old mother? For a long time I&rsquo;ve
been wandering over these wild mountains in search of
the Glass Hill and the Three Citrons. At the Silver
Castle they sent me to you because they thought you
might know something about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Glass Hill? No, I don&rsquo;t know where it is.
But wait until my son comes. He will advise you
where to go and what to do. Hide under the table
and stay there till I call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mountains rumbled and the castle trembled and
Yezibaba&rsquo;s son came home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew! Phew! I smell human meat! I&rsquo;ll eat
it!&rdquo; he roared. He stood in the doorway and pounded
the ground with his golden club until the whole castle
shook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my son,&rdquo; said Yezibaba, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk that
way! A pretty little fellow has come bringing you
greetings from your brother of the Silver Castle. If
you won&rsquo;t harm him, I&rsquo;ll call him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if my brother didn&rsquo;t do anything to him, I
won&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the prince crawled out from under the table and
stood before the giant. It was like standing beneath a
high tower. He showed the ogre the silver dumplings
as proof that he had been at the Silver Castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, well, well, my little June bug,&rdquo; shouted the
monstrous fellow, &ldquo;tell me what it is you want! I&rsquo;ll
advise you if I can! Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the prince told him the purpose of his journey
and asked him how to get to the Glass Hill and pluck
the Three Citrons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that blackish lump over yonder?&rdquo;
the ogre said, pointing with his golden club. &ldquo;That
is the Glass Hill. On that hill stands a tree. From
that tree hang the Three Citrons which send out fragrance
for seven miles around. You will climb the Glass
Hill, kneel beneath the tree, and reach up your hands.
If the citrons are destined for you they will fall into
your hands of their own accord. If they are not destined
for you, you will not be able to pluck them no
matter what you do. As you return, if you are hungry
or thirsty, cut open one of the citrons and you will
have food and drink in plenty. Go now with God&rsquo;s
blessing. But wait! I can&rsquo;t let you go away hungry!
Hi, mother, bring out the dumplings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yezibaba set a large golden dish on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; her son shouted. &ldquo;Or, if you are not
hungry just now, put some in your pocket and eat
them on the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince said that he was not hungry but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
he would be glad to take some of the golden dumplings
with him and eat them later. Then he thanked the ogre
most courteously for his hospitality and advice and
took his leave.</p>

<p>He trudged quickly on from hill to dale, from dale
to hill again, and never stopped until he reached the
Glass Hill itself. Then he stood still as if turned
into stone. The hill was high and steep and smooth
with not so much as a scratch on its surface. Over its
top spread out the branches of the magic tree upon
which hung the Three Citrons. Their fragrance was
so powerful that the prince almost fainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be as God wills!&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;But however the adventure is to come out, now that
I&rsquo;m here I must at least make the attempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he began to claw his way up the smooth glass,
but he hadn&rsquo;t gone many yards before his foot slipped
and down he went so hard that he didn&rsquo;t know where
he was or what had happened to him until he found
himself sitting on the ground.</p>

<p>In his vexation he began to throw away the dumplings,
thinking that perhaps their weight had dragged
him down. He took one and threw it straight at the
hill. Imagine his surprise to see it fix itself firmly in
the glass. He threw a second and a third and there he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
had three steps on which he was able to stand with
safety!</p>

<p>The prince was overjoyed. He threw dumpling after
dumpling and each one of them became a step. First
he threw the leaden ones, then the silver ones, and last
of all the golden ones. On the steps made in this way
he climbed higher and higher until he had reached
the very summit of the hill. Then he knelt under the
magic tree, lifted up his hands, and into them the
Three Citrons dropped of their own accord!</p>

<p>Instantly the tree disappeared, the Glass Hill sank
until it was lost, and when the prince came to himself
there was neither tree nor hill to be seen, but only a
wide plain.</p>

<p>Delighted with the outcome of his adventure, the
prince turned homewards. At first he was too happy
even to eat or drink. By the third day his stomach
began to protest and he discovered that he was so
hungry that he would have fallen ravenously upon a
leaden dumpling if he had had one in his pocket. But
his pocket, alas, was empty, and the country all about
was as bare as the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>Then he remembered what the ogre of the Golden
Castle had told him and he took out one of the Three
Citrons. He cut it open, and what do you suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
happened? Out jumped a beautiful maiden fresh from
the hand of God, who bowed low before him and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you food ready for me? Have you drink
ready for me? Have you pretty clothes ready for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, beautiful creature,&rdquo; the prince sighed, &ldquo;I
have not. I have nothing for you to eat or to drink
or to put on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lovely maiden clapped her hands three times,
bowed before him, and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;now I know what kind of
citrons you are! I&rsquo;ll think twice before opening one
of you again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the one he had opened he ate and drank his
fill, and so refreshed, went on. He traveled three days
and three nights and by that time he began to feel
three times hungrier than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I must eat something!
There are still two citrons and if I cut open
one there would still be one left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took out the second citron, cut it in two, and
lo, a maiden twice as beautiful as the first stood before
him. She bowed low and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you food ready for me? Have you drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
ready for me? Have you pretty clothes ready for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, lovely creature, I haven&rsquo;t! I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden clapped her hands thrice, bowed before
him, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Now there was only one citron left. The prince
took it in his hand, looked at it, and said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
cut you open until I&rsquo;m safe at home in my father&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up his journey again and on the third
day he came to his native town and his father&rsquo;s castle.
He had been gone a long time and how he ever got
back he didn&rsquo;t know himself.</p>

<p>Tears of joy rained down the old king&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome home, my son, welcome a hundred
times!&rdquo; he cried, falling on the prince&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>The prince related the adventures of his journey
and they at home told him how anxiously they had
awaited his return.</p>

<p>On the next day a great feast was prepared. All
the nobles in the land were invited. The tables were
spread with food and drink the most expensive in the
world and many rich dresses embroidered in gold and
studded with pearls were laid out.</p>

<p>The guests assembled, seated themselves at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
tables, and waited. Music played and when all was
ready, the prince took the last citron and cut it in two.
Out jumped a beautiful creature, three times lovelier
than the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you food ready for me?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Have
you drink ready for me? Have you pretty clothes
ready for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have indeed, dear heart!&rdquo; the prince answered.
&ldquo;I have everything ready for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led her to the gorgeous clothes and she dressed
herself in them and every one present marveled at her
great beauty.</p>

<p>Soon the betrothal took place and after the betrothal
a magnificent wedding.</p>

<p>So now the old king&rsquo;s wish was fulfilled. He
blessed his son, gave over the kingdom to him, and not
long afterwards he died.</p>

<p>The first thing that faced the young king after
his father&rsquo;s death was a war which a neighboring king
stirred up against him. So the young king had to
bid farewell to the bride whom he had won so dearly
and lead his men to battle. In order that nothing
happen to the queen in his absence, he built a golden
throne for her in the garden beside the lake. This
throne was as high as a tower and no one could ascend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
it except those to whom the queen let down a silken
cord.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Music Played</i></p>

<p>Not far from the king&rsquo;s castle lived the old woman
who, in the first place, had told him about the Three
Citrons. She knew well enough how the young king
had won his bride and she was deeply incensed that he
had not invited her to the wedding and in fact had not
even thanked her for her good advice.</p>

<p>Now this old woman had a gipsy for servant whom
she used to send to the lake for water. One day when
this gipsy was filling her pitcher, she saw in the lake
a beautiful reflection. She supposed it was a reflection
of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it right,&rdquo; she cried out, &ldquo;that so lovely a creature
as I should carry water for that old witch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a fury she threw the pitcher on the ground and
broke it into a hundred pieces. Then she looked up
and discovered that it wasn&rsquo;t her own reflection she had
seen in the water but that of the beautiful queen.</p>

<p>Ashamed of herself, she picked up the broken
pitcher and went home. The old woman, who knew
beforehand what had happened, went out to meet her
with a new pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter about the pitcher,&rdquo; the old woman
said. &ldquo;Go back to the lake and beg the lovely lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
to let down the silken cord and pull you up. Tell her
you will comb her hair. When she pulls you up, comb
her hair until she falls asleep. Then stick this pin
into her head. After that you can dress yourself up
in her clothes and sit there like a queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was easy enough to persuade the gipsy. She
took the pitcher and the pin and returned to the lake.</p>

<p>As she drew water she gazed at the lovely queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how beautiful you are!&rdquo; she whined, leering
up at the queen with an evil eye. &ldquo;How beautiful
you are! Aye, but you&rsquo;d be a hundred times more
beautiful if you but let me comb out your lovely hair!
Indeed, I would so twine those golden tresses that
your lord would be delighted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With words like these she beguiled and coaxed
the queen until she let down the silken cord and drew
the gipsy up. Once on the throne, the wicked gipsy
combed out the golden tresses and plaited them and
arranged them until the queen fell sound asleep. Then
the gipsy took the pin and stuck it into the queen&rsquo;s head.
Instantly a beautiful white dove flew off the golden
throne and not a trace was left of the lovely queen
except her rich clothing. The gipsy dressed herself
in this, sat in the queen&rsquo;s place, and gazed down into
the lake. But in the lake no lovely reflection showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
itself, for even in the queen&rsquo;s clothes the gipsy remained
a gipsy.</p>

<p>The young king waged a successful war against his
enemies and made peace. Scarcely had he got home
when he hurried to the garden to see whether anything
had happened to his heart&rsquo;s delight. Who can express
in words his astonishment and horror when instead of
his beautiful wife he saw the evil gipsy!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dearest one, how you have changed!&rdquo;
he murmured and tears flowed down his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I have changed, I know I have,&rdquo;
the gipsy answered. &ldquo;It was grief for you that has
broken me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to fall on his neck but the king turned
quickly away and left her.</p>

<p>From that time forth he had no peace but day and
night he mourned the lost beauty of his wife and
nothing consoled him.</p>

<p>Grieving in this way and thinking always the same
sad thoughts, he was walking one day in the garden
when suddenly a beautiful white dove flew down from
a high tree and alighted on his hand. She looked up
at him with eyes as mournful as his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor dove,&rdquo; the king said, &ldquo;why are you
so sad? Has your mate also changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
As he spoke he stroked the dove gently on the
back and on the head. On the head he felt a little
lump. He blew aside the feathers and discovered the
head of a pin. He pulled out the pin and instantly
the sad dove changed into his own beautiful wife.</p>

<p>She told him what had happened to her, how the
gipsy had deceived her and stuck the pin into her head.
The king had the gipsy and the old witch caught at
once and burnt at the stake.</p>

<p>From that time on nothing happened to mar the
king&rsquo;s happiness, neither the plots of his enemies nor
the spite of evil people. He lived in love and peace
with his beautiful wife and he ruled his kingdom wisely.
In fact he&rsquo;s ruling it still if he hasn&rsquo;t died.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">PRINCE BAYAYA</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE the king of a distant country was off at
the wars, his wife, the queen, gave birth to twin
sons. There was great rejoicing throughout the court
and immediately messengers were despatched to the
king to carry him news of the happy event.</p>

<p>Both boys were well and vigorous and shot up like
little trees. The one who was about a moment the
older was the hardier of the two. Even as a toddling
child he was forever playing in the courtyard and
struggling to climb on the back of a horse that had
been given him because it was just his own age.</p>

<p>His brother, on the other hand, liked better to play
indoors on the soft carpets. He was always tagging
after his mother and never went outdoors except when
he followed the queen into the garden. For this reason
the younger prince became the mother&rsquo;s favorite.</p>

<p>The boys were seven years old before the king
returned from the wars. He looked at his sons with
pride and joy and he said to the queen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
&ldquo;But which is the older and which is the younger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queen, thinking that the king was asking in
order to know which was the heir to the throne, slipped
in her favorite as the older. The king, of course, did
not question his wife&rsquo;s word and so, thereafter, he
always spoke of the younger one as his heir.</p>

<p>When the boys had grown into handsome youths,
the older one wearied of life at home and of hearing
his brother always spoken of as the future king. He
longed to go out into the world and seek adventures
of his own. One day as he was pouring out his heart
to the little horse that had been his companion from
infancy, much to his amazement the horse spoke to
him with a human voice and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are not happy at home, go out into the
world. But do not go without your father&rsquo;s permission.
I advise you to take no one with you and to mount no
horse but me. This will bring you good luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince asked the horse how it happened that
he could talk like a human being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me about that,&rdquo; the horse said, &ldquo;for
I can&rsquo;t tell you. But I wish to be your friend and
counselor and I will be as long as you obey me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 501px;">
<a name="boys" id="boys"></a>
<img src="images/cft11.png" width="501" height="600"
alt="The twin princes on horseback" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><i>When the Boys Had Grown into Handsome Youths</i></p>

<p>The prince promised to do as the horse advised.
He went at once to his father to beg his leave to ride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
out into the world. At first his father was unwilling
to let him go but his mother gave her permission at
once. By dint of coaxing he finally won his father&rsquo;s
consent. Of course the king wanted the prince to set
forth in a manner befitting his rank with a great company
of men and horses. But the prince insisted that
he wished to go unattended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear father, do I need any such retinue
as you suggest? Let me have some money for the
journey and let me ride off alone on my own little
horse. This will give me more freedom and less
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he had to argue with his father for some
time, but at last he succeeded in arranging everything
to his liking.</p>

<p>The day of parting came. The little horse stood
saddled at the castle gate. The prince bade farewell
to his parents and his brother. They all wept on his
neck and at the last moment the queen&rsquo;s heart misgave
her for the deceit she had practised and she made
the prince solemnly promise that he would return home
within a year or at least send them word of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>So the prince mounted his little horse and off they
trotted. The horse went at a surprising pace for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
animal that was seventeen years old, but of course
you have guessed before this that he was no ordinary
horse. The years had not touched him at all. His
coat was as smooth as satin and his legs were straight
and sound. No matter how far he traveled he was
always as fresh as a fawn.</p>

<p>He carried the prince a great distance until they
came in sight of the towers of a beautiful city. Then
the horse left the beaten track and crossed a field to
a big rock.</p>

<p>When they reached the rock, the horse kicked it
with his hoof three times and the rock opened. They
rode inside and the prince found himself in a comfortable
stable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you will leave me here,&rdquo; the horse said,
&ldquo;and go on alone to the nearby town. You must
pretend you are dumb and be careful never to betray
yourself. Present yourself at court and have the king
take you into his service. When you need anything,
no matter what it is, come to the rock, knock three
times, and the rock will open to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince thought to himself: &ldquo;My horse certainly
knows what he&rsquo;s about, so of course I&rsquo;ll do exactly as
he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disguised himself by bandaging one eye and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
making his face look pale and sallow. Then he
presented himself at court and the king, pitying his
youth and his affliction of dumbness, took him into
his service.</p>

<p>The prince was capable and quick at affairs and it
wasn&rsquo;t long before the king gave over to him the
management of the household. His advice was asked
in matters of importance and all day long he hurried
about the castle going from one thing to another. If
the king needed a scribe, there wasn&rsquo;t a cleverer one
anywhere than the prince. Everybody liked him and
everybody was soon calling him Bayaya, because those
were the only sounds he made.</p>

<p>The king had three daughters, each more beautiful
than the other. The oldest was called Zdobena, the
second Budinka, and the youngest Slavena.</p>

<p>The prince loved to be with the three girls and as
he was supposed to be dumb and in his disguise was
very ugly, the king made no objection to his spending
his days with them. How could the king possibly
think that there was any danger of Bayaya&rsquo;s stealing
the heart of one of the princesses? They liked him, all
three of them, and were always taking him with them
wherever they went. He wove garlands for them, spun
golden thread, picked them flowers, and drew them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
designs of birds and flowers for their embroidery. He
liked them all, but he liked the youngest one best.
Everything he did for her was done a little better
than for the others. The garlands he wove her were
richer, the designs he drew for her were more beautiful.
The two older sisters noticed this and laughed,
and when they were alone they teased Slavena.
Slavena, who had a sweet and amiable disposition, accepted
their joking without retort.</p>

<p>Bayaya had been at the court some time when one
morning he found the king sitting sad and gloomy over
his breakfast. So by signs he asked him what was the
matter.</p>

<p>The king looked at him and sighed. &ldquo;Is it possible,
my dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the
matter? Don&rsquo;t you know the calamity that threatens
us? Don&rsquo;t you know the bitter three days that are
at hand for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayaya, alarmed by the seriousness of the king&rsquo;s
manner, shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;although you
can be of no help. Years ago three dragons came flying
through the air and alighted on a great rock near
here. The first was nine-headed, the second eighteen-headed,
and the third twenty-seven-headed. At once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
they laid waste the country, devouring the cattle and
killing the people. Soon the city was in a state of siege.
To keep them away we placed all the food we had outside
the gates and in a short time we ourselves were
starving. In desperation I had an old wise woman
called to court and asked her was there any way to
drive these monsters from the land. Alas for me, there
was a way and that way was to promise the awful
creatures my three beautiful daughters when they
reached womanhood. At that time my daughters were
only small children and I thought to myself many
things might happen in the years before they grew
up. So, to relieve my stricken land, I promised the
dragons my daughters. The poor queen died at once
of grief, but my daughters grew up knowing nothing
of their fate. As soon as I made the monstrous bargain,
the dragons flew away and until yesterday were
never again heard of. Last night, a shepherd, beside
himself with terror, brought me the news that the
dragons are again settled in their old rock and are
sending out fearful roars. Tomorrow I must sacrifice
to them my oldest child, the day after tomorrow my
second child, and the day after that my youngest.
Then I shall be left a poor lonely old man with
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
The king strode up and down and tore his hair
in grief.</p>

<p>In great distress Bayaya went to the princesses.
He found them dressed in black and looking ghastly
pale. They were sitting in a row and bewailing their
fate most piteously. Bayaya tried to comfort them,
telling them by signs that surely some one would appear
to rescue them. But they paid no heed to him
and kept on moaning and weeping.</p>

<p>Grief and confusion spread throughout the city,
for every one loved the royal family. Every house
as well as the palace was soon draped in black and
the sound of mourning was heard on every side.</p>

<p>Bayaya hurried secretly out of the city and across
the field to the rock where his magic horse was stabled.
He knocked three times, the rock opened, and he
entered.</p>

<p>He stroked the horse&rsquo;s shining mane and kissed his
muzzle in greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear horse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to you
for advice. Help me and I shall be happy forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he told the horse the story of the dragons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all about those dragons,&rdquo; the horse
answered. &ldquo;In fact, it was that you might rescue the
princesses that I brought you here in the first place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
Early tomorrow morning come back and I will tell you
what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayaya returned to the castle with such joy shining
in his face that if any one had noticed him he
would have been severely rebuked. He spent the day
with the princesses trying to comfort and console them,
but in spite of all he could do they felt only more terrified
as the hours went by.</p>

<p>The next day at the first streak of dawn he was at
the rock.</p>

<p>The horse greeted him and said: &ldquo;Lift up the
stone under my trough and take out what you find
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayaya obeyed. He lifted the stone and under the
stone he found a large chest. Inside the chest he found
three beautiful suits of clothing, with caps and plumes
to match, a sword, and a horse&rsquo;s bridle. The first
suit was red embroidered in silver and studded with
diamonds, the second was pure white embroidered in
gold, and the third was light blue richly embroidered
with silver and studded with diamonds and pearls.</p>

<p>For all three suits there was but one mighty sword.
Its blade was beautifully inlaid and its scabbard shone
with precious stones. The horse&rsquo;s bridle was also richly
jeweled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
&ldquo;All three suits are for you,&rdquo; the horse said. &ldquo;For
the first day, put on the red one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bayaya dressed himself in the red suit, buckled
on his sword, and threw the bridle over the horse&rsquo;s
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; the horse said as they left the
rock. &ldquo;Cut bravely into the monster, trusting to your
sword. And remember, do not dismount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the castle heartbroken farewells were being
taken. Zdobena parted from her father and her sisters,
stepped into a carriage, and accompanied by a great
multitude of her weeping subjects was slowly driven
out of town to the Dragon Rock. As they neared the
fatal spot the princess alighted. She took a few steps
forward, then sank to the earth in a faint.</p>

<p>At that moment the people saw galloping toward
them a knight with a red and white plume. In a voice
of authority he ordered them to stand back and leave
him to deal alone with the dragon. They were glad
enough to lead the princess away and they all went to
a hill near by from which they could watch the combat
at a safe distance.</p>

<p>Now there was a deep rumbling noise, the earth
shook, and the Dragon Rock opened. A nine-headed
monster crawled out. He spat fire and poison from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
all his nine mouths and cast about his nine heads, this
way and that, looking for his promised prey. When
he saw the knight he let out a horrible roar.</p>

<p>Bayaya rode straight at him and with one blow of
his sword cut off three of his heads. The dragon
writhed and enveloped Bayaya in flames and poisonous
fumes. But the prince, undaunted, struck at him again
and again until he had cut off all nine heads. The
life that still remained in the loathsome body, the horse
finished with his hoofs.</p>

<p>When the dragon had perished the prince turned
and galloped back the way he had come.</p>

<p>Zdobena looked after him, wishing she might follow
him to thank him for her deliverance. But she remembered
her poor father sunk in grief at the castle
and she felt it was her duty to hurry back to him as
quickly as she could.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe in words the
king&rsquo;s joy when Zdobena appeared before him safe
and uninjured. Her sisters embraced her and wondered
for the first time whether a deliverer would rise
up for them as well.</p>

<p>Bayaya capered happily about and assured them
by signs that he was certain they, too, would be saved.
Although the prospect of the morrow still terrified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
them, yet hope had come to them and once or twice
Bayaya succeeded in making them laugh.</p>

<p>The next day Budinka was led out. As on the day
before, the unknown knight appeared, this time wearing
a white plume. He attacked the eighteen-headed
dragon and, after valiant conflict, despatched him.
Then before any one could reach him, he turned and
rode away.</p>

<p>The princess returned to the castle, grieving that
she had not been able to speak to the knight and express
her gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, my sisters,&rdquo; Slavena said, &ldquo;were backward
not to speak to him before he rode off. Tomorrow if
he delivers me I shall kneel before him and not get up
until he consents to return with me to the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Bayaya began laughing and chuckling
and Slavena asked him sharply what was the matter.
He capered about and made her understand that he,
too, wanted to see the knight.</p>

<p>On the third day Slavena was taken out to the
Dragon Rock. This time the king also went. The
heart of the poor girl quaked with terror when she
thought that if the unknown knight failed to appear
she would be handed over to the horrible monster.</p>

<p>A joyous shout from the people told her that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
knight was coming. Then she saw him, a gallant figure
in blue with a blue and white plume floating in the
wind. As he had killed the first dragon, and the second
dragon, so he killed the third although the struggle was
longer and the little horse had much to do to stand up
against the poisonous fumes.</p>

<p>Instantly the dragon was slain, Slavena and the
king rushed up to the knight and begged him to return
with them to the castle. He scarcely knew how to refuse,
especially when Slavena, kneeling before him,
grasped the edge of his tunic and looked up at him
so bewitchingly that his heart melted and he was ready
to do anything she asked.</p>

<p>But the little horse took matters into his own hands,
reared up suddenly, and galloped off before the knight
had time to dismount.</p>

<p>So Slavena, too, was unable to bring the knight
back to the castle. The king and all the court were
greatly disappointed but their disappointment was
swallowed up in their joy that the princesses had been
so miraculously saved.</p>

<p>Shortly after this another disaster threatened the
king. A neighboring king of great power declared
war against him. The king sent far and wide and
summoned together all the nobles of the land. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
came, and the king when he had laid before them his
cause promised them the hands of his three beautiful
daughters in return for their support. This was indeed
an inducement and every young noble present
swore his allegiance and hurried home to gather his
forces.</p>

<p>Troops poured in from all sides and soon the king
was ready to set forth.</p>

<p>He handed over the affairs of the castle to Bayaya
and also intrusted to him the safety of the three princesses.
Bayaya did his duty faithfully, looking after
the castle and planning diversions for the princesses to
keep them happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>Then one day he complained of feeling sick, but
instead of consulting the court physician, he said he
would go himself to the fields and hunt some herbs.
The princesses laughed at his whim but let him go.</p>

<p>He hurried to the rock where his horse was stabled,
knocked three times, and entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come in good time,&rdquo; the horse said.
&ldquo;The king&rsquo;s forces are weakening and tomorrow will
decide the battle. Put on the white suit, take your
sword, and let us be off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayaya kissed his brave little horse and put on his
white suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
That night the king was awake planning the morrow&rsquo;s
battle and sending swift messengers to his daughters
instructing them what to do in case the day went
against him.</p>

<p>The next morning as the battle joined an unknown
knight suddenly appeared among the king&rsquo;s forces.
He was all in white. He rode a little horse and he
wielded a mighty sword.</p>

<p>He struck right and left among the enemy and he
caused such havoc that the king&rsquo;s forces were instantly
heartened. Gathering around the white knight they
fought so valiantly that soon the enemy broke and
scattered and the king won a mighty victory.</p>

<p>The knight himself was slightly wounded on the
foot. When the king saw this he jumped down from
his horse, tore off a piece of his own cape, and bound
up the wound. He begged the knight to dismount and
come with him to a tent. But the knight, thanking
him, refused, spurred his horse, and was gone.</p>

<p>The king nearly wept with disappointment that
the unknown knight to whom he was under one more
obligation had again ridden off without so much as
leaving his name.</p>

<p>With great rejoicing the king&rsquo;s forces marched
home carrying vast stores of booty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, steward,&rdquo; said the king to Bayaya, &ldquo;how
have the affairs of the household gone in my absence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bayaya nodded that everything had gone well, but
the princesses laughed at him and Slavena said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must enter complaint against your steward, for
he was disobedient. He said he was sick but he would
not consult the court physician. He said he wanted
to go himself and get some herbs. He went and he
was gone two whole days and when he came back
he was sicker than before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king looked at Bayaya to see if he was still
sick. Bayaya shook his head and capered about to
show the king that he was all right.</p>

<p>When the princesses heard that the unknown knight
had again appeared and saved the day they were unwilling
to become at once the brides of any of the
nobles, for they thought the knight might perhaps
come demanding one of them.</p>

<p>Again the king was in a quandary. All the various
nobles had helped him valiantly and the question now
arose to what three of them would the princesses be
awarded. After much thought the king hit upon a
plan which he hoped would decide the matter to the
satisfaction of them all. He called a meeting of the
nobles and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
&ldquo;My dear comrades in arms, you remember that I
promised the hands of my daughters to those of you
who would support me in battle. All of you gave me
valiant support. Each of you deserves the hand of one
of my daughters. But, alas, I have only three daughters.
To decide therefore which three of you my
daughters shall marry I make this suggestion: let all
of you stand in the garden in a row and let each of
my daughters throw down a golden apple from a
balcony. Then each princess must wed the man to
whom her apple rolls. My lords, do you all agree
to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nobles all agreed and the king sent for his
daughters. The princesses, still thinking of the unknown
knight, were not enthusiastic over this arrangement,
but not to shame their father they, too, agreed.</p>

<p>So each of the girls, dressed in her loveliest, took
a golden apple in her hand and went up to a balcony.</p>

<p>Below in the garden the nobles stood in a row.
Bayaya, as though he were a spectator, took his place
at the end of the line.</p>

<p>First Zdobena threw down her apple. It rolled
straight to the feet of Bayaya but he turned quickly
aside and it rolled on to a handsome youth who
snatched it up with joy and stepped from the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
Then Budinka threw her apple. It, too, rolled to
Bayaya but he cleverly kicked it on so that it seemed
to roll straight to the feet of a valiant lord who picked
it up and then looked with happy eyes at his lovely
bride.</p>

<p>Last Slavena threw her apple. This time Bayaya
did not step aside but when the apple rolled to him
he stooped and picked it up. Then he ran to the
balcony, knelt before the princess, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>Slavena snatched away her hand and ran to her
chamber, where she wept bitterly to think she would
have to marry Bayaya instead of the unknown knight.</p>

<p>The king was much disappointed and the nobles
murmured. But what was done was done, and could
not be undone.</p>

<p>That night there was a great feast but Slavena
remained in her chamber refusing to appear among
the guests.</p>

<p>It was moonlight and from the rock in the field
the little horse carried his master for the last time.
When they reached the castle Bayaya dismounted.
Then he kissed his faithful friend farewell, and the
little horse vanished.</p>

<p>Slavena still sat in her chamber, sad and unhappy.
When a maidservant opened the door and said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
Bayaya wished to speak to her, the princess hid her
face in the pillows.</p>

<p>Presently some one took her by the hand and when
she raised her head she saw standing before her the
beautiful knight of her dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you angry with your bridegroom that you
hide from him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me that?&rdquo; Slavena whispered.
&ldquo;You are not my bridegroom. Bayaya is my bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Bayaya. I am the dumb youth who wove
you garlands. I am the knight who saved you and
your sisters from death and who helped your father in
battle. See, here is the piece of your father&rsquo;s cape with
which he bound up my wounded foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That this was so was joy indeed to Slavena. She
led the white knight into the banquet hall and presented
him to the king as her bridegroom. When all had
been explained, the king rejoiced, the guests marveled,
and Zdobena and Budinka looked sideways at each
other with little gasps of envy.</p>

<p>After the wedding Bayaya rode away with Slavena
to visit his parents. When he reached his native town
the first news he got was of the death of his brother.
He hurried to the castle to comfort his parents. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
were overjoyed at his return, for they had long ago
given him up for dead.</p>

<p>After a time Bayaya succeeded to the kingdom.
He lived long and prospered and he enjoyed unclouded
happiness with his wife.</p>

<h2>KATCHA AND THE DEVIL</h2>

<p class="center">THE STORY OF A CLINGING VINE</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span></p>

<p class="center lrgfont">KATCHA AND THE DEVIL</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a woman named Katcha who
lived in a village where she owned her own cottage
and garden. She had money besides but little good
it did her because she was such an ill-tempered vixen
that nobody, not even the poorest laborer, would marry
her. Nobody would even work for her, no matter what
she paid, for she couldn&rsquo;t open her mouth without
scolding, and whenever she scolded she raised her shrill
voice until you could hear it a mile away. The older
she grew the worse she became until by the time she
was forty she was as sour as vinegar.</p>

<p>Now as it always happens in a village, every Sunday
afternoon there was a dance either at the burgomaster&rsquo;s,
or at the tavern. As soon as the bagpipes
sounded, the boys all crowded into the room and the
girls gathered outside and looked in the windows.
Katcha was always the first at the window. The music
would strike up and the boys would beckon the girls
to come in and dance, but no one ever beckoned Katcha.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
Even when she paid the piper no one ever asked her to
dance. Yet she came Sunday after Sunday just the
same.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon as she was hurrying to the
tavern she thought to herself: &ldquo;Here I am getting old
and yet I&rsquo;ve never once danced with a boy! Plague
take it, today I&rsquo;d dance with the devil if he asked me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in a fine rage by the time she reached the
tavern, where she sat down near the stove and looked
around to see what girls the boys had invited to dance.</p>

<p>Suddenly a stranger in hunter&rsquo;s green came in. He
sat down at a table near Katcha and ordered drink.
When the serving maid brought the beer, he reached
over to Katcha and asked her to drink with him. At
first she was much taken back at this attention, then
she pursed her lips coyly and pretended to refuse, but
finally she accepted.</p>

<p>When they had finished drinking, he pulled a ducat
from his pocket, tossed it to the piper, and called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear the floor, boys! This is for Katcha and me
alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys snickered and the girls giggled hiding behind
each other and stuffing their aprons into their
mouths so that Katcha wouldn&rsquo;t hear them laughing.
But Katcha wasn&rsquo;t noticing them at all. Katcha was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
dancing with a fine young man! If the whole world
had been laughing at her, Katcha wouldn&rsquo;t have cared.</p>

<p>The stranger danced with Katcha all afternoon and
all evening. Not once did he dance with any one else.
He bought her marzipan and sweet drinks and, when
the hour came to go home, he escorted her through the
village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed Katcha when they reached her cottage
and it was time to part, &ldquo;I wish I could dance
with you forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your arm around my neck and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katcha put both arms about his neck and instantly
the man changed into a devil and flew straight down
to hell.</p>

<p>At the gates of hell he stopped and knocked.</p>

<p>His comrades came and opened the gates and when
they saw that he was exhausted, they tried to take
Katcha off his neck. But Katcha held on tight and
nothing they could do or say would make her budge.</p>

<p>The devil finally had to appear before the Prince
of Darkness himself with Katcha still glued to his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that thing you&rsquo;ve got around your neck?&rdquo;
the Prince asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
So the devil told how as he was walking about on
earth he had heard Katcha say she would dance with
the devil himself if he asked her. &ldquo;So I asked her to
dance with me,&rdquo; the devil said. &ldquo;Afterwards just to
frighten her a little I brought her down to hell. And
now she won&rsquo;t let go of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve you right, you dunce!&rdquo; the Prince said.
&ldquo;How often have I told you to use common sense when
you go wandering around on earth! You might have
known Katcha would never let go of a man once she
had him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your Majesty to make her let go!&rdquo; the
poor devil implored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to
carry her back to earth yourself and get rid of her as
best you can. Perhaps this will be a lesson to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the devil, very tired and very cross, shambled
back to earth with Katcha still clinging to his neck.
He tried every way to get her off. He promised her
wooded hills and rich meadows if she but let him go.
He cajoled her, he cursed her, but all to no avail.
Katcha still held on.</p>

<p>Breathless and discouraged he came at last to a
meadow where a shepherd, wrapped in a great shaggy
sheepskin coat, was tending his flocks. The devil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
transformed himself into an ordinary looking man so that
the shepherd didn&rsquo;t recognize him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; the shepherd said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re
carrying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; the devil said with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so worn out I&rsquo;m nearly dead. I was walking yonder
not thinking of anything at all when along comes a
woman and jumps on my back and won&rsquo;t let go. I&rsquo;m
trying to carry her to the nearest village to get rid
of her there, but I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m able. My legs are
giving out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd, who was a good-natured chap, said:
&ldquo;I tell you what: I&rsquo;ll help you. I can&rsquo;t leave my
sheep long, but I&rsquo;ll carry her halfway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very grateful if you
did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the shepherd yelled at Katcha: &ldquo;Hi, there, you!
Catch hold of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Katcha saw that the shepherd was a handsome
youth, she let go of the devil and leapt upon the
shepherd&rsquo;s back, catching hold of the collar of his
sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>Now the young shepherd soon found that the long
shaggy coat and Katcha made a pretty heavy load for
walking. In a few moments he was sick of his bargain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
and began casting about for some way of getting rid
of Katcha.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a pond and he thought to
himself that he&rsquo;d like to throw her in. He wondered
how he could do it. Perhaps he could manage it by
throwing in his greatcoat with her. The coat was so
loose that he thought he could slip out of it without
Katcha&rsquo;s discovering what he was doing. Very cautiously
he slipped out one arm. Katcha didn&rsquo;t move.
He slipped out the other arm. Still Katcha didn&rsquo;t
move. He unlooped the first button. Katcha noticed
nothing. He unlooped the second button. Still Katcha
noticed nothing. He unlooped the third button
and kerplunk! he had pitched coat and Katcha and all
into the middle of the pond!</p>

<p>When he got back to his sheep, the devil looked at
him in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Katcha?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the shepherd said, pointing over his shoulder
with his thumb, &ldquo;I decided to leave her up yonder in
a pond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; the devil cried, &ldquo;I thank you!
You have done me a great favor. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for you I might be carrying Katcha till doomsday.
I&rsquo;ll never forget you and some time I&rsquo;ll reward you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
As you don&rsquo;t know who it is you&rsquo;ve helped, I must
tell you I&rsquo;m a devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words the devil vanished.</p>

<p>For a moment the shepherd was dazed. Then he
laughed and said to himself: &ldquo;Well, if they&rsquo;re all as
stupid as he is, we ought to be able for them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The country where the shepherd lived was ruled
over by a dissolute young duke who passed his days
in riotous living and his nights in carousing. He gave
over the affairs of state to two governors who were as
bad as he. With extortionate taxes and unjust fines
they robbed the people until the whole land was
crying out against them.</p>

<p>Now one day for amusement the duke summoned
an astrologer to court and ordered him to read in the
planets the fate of himself and his two governors.
When the astrologer had cast a horoscope for each
of the three reprobates, he was greatly disturbed and
tried to dissuade the duke from questioning him further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such danger,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;threatens your life and
the lives of your two governors that I fear to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;speak. But I
warn you to speak the truth, for if what you say does
not come to pass you will forfeit your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
The astrologer bowed and said: &ldquo;Hear then, oh
Duke, what the planets foretell: Before the second
quarter of the moon, on such and such a day, at such
and such an hour, a devil will come and carry off the
two governors. At the full of the moon on such and
such a day, at such and such an hour, the same devil
will come for your Highness and carry you off to
hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duke pretended to be unconcerned but in his
heart he was deeply shaken. The voice of the astrologer
sounded to him like the voice of judgment and
for the first time conscience began to trouble him.</p>

<p>As for the governors, they couldn&rsquo;t eat a bite of
food and were carried from the palace half dead with
fright. They piled their ill-gotten wealth into wagons
and rode away to their castles, where they barred all
the doors and windows in order to keep the devil out.</p>

<p>The duke reformed. He gave up his evil ways and
corrected the abuses of state in the hope of averting if
possible his cruel fate.</p>

<p>The poor shepherd had no inkling of any of these
things. He tended his flocks from day to day and
never bothered his head about the happenings in the
great world.</p>

<p>Suddenly one day the devil appeared before him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
and said: &ldquo;I have come, my friend, to repay you for
your kindness. When the moon is in its first quarter,
I was to carry off the former governors of this land
because they robbed the poor and gave the duke evil
counsel. However, they&rsquo;re behaving themselves now so
they&rsquo;re to be given another chance. But they don&rsquo;t
know this. Now on such and such a day do you go to
the first castle where a crowd of people will be assembled.
When a cry goes up and the gates open and
I come dragging out the governor, do you step up to
me and say: &lsquo;What do you mean by this? Get out of
here or there&rsquo;ll be trouble!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pretend to be greatly
frightened and make off. Then ask the governor to
pay you two bags of gold, and if he haggles just
threaten to call me back. After that go on to the
castle of the second governor and do the same thing
and demand the same pay. I warn you, though, be
prudent with the money and use it only for good.
When the moon is full, I&rsquo;m to carry off the duke himself,
for he was so wicked that he&rsquo;s to have no second
chance. So don&rsquo;t try to save him, for if you do you&rsquo;ll
pay for it with your own skin. Don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd remembered carefully everything the
devil told him. When the moon was in its first quarter
he went to the first castle. A great crowd of people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
was gathered outside waiting to see the devil carry
away the governor.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud cry of despair, the
gates of the castle opened, and there was the devil,
as black as night, dragging out the governor. He,
poor man, was half dead with fright.</p>

<p>The shepherd elbowed his way through the crowd,
took the governor by the hand, and pushed the devil
roughly aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Get
out of here or there&rsquo;ll be trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the devil fled and the governor fell on
his knees before the shepherd and kissed his hands and
begged him to state what he wanted in reward. When
the shepherd asked for two bags of gold, the governor
ordered that they be given him without delay.</p>

<p>Then the shepherd went to the castle of the second
governor and went through exactly the same performance.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the duke soon heard of
the shepherd, for he had been anxiously awaiting the
fate of the two governors. At once he sent a wagon
with four horses to fetch the shepherd to the palace and
when the shepherd arrived he begged him piteously to
rescue him likewise from the devil&rsquo;s clutches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; the shepherd answered, &ldquo;I cannot promise
you anything. I have to consider my own safety.
You have been a great sinner, but if you really want
to reform, if you really want to rule your people justly
and kindly and wisely as becomes a true ruler, then
indeed I will help you even if I have to suffer hellfire
in your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duke declared that with God&rsquo;s help he would
mend his ways and the shepherd promised to come back
on the fatal day.</p>

<p>With grief and dread the whole country awaited
the coming of the full moon. In the first place the
people had greeted the astrologer&rsquo;s prophecy with joy,
but since the duke had reformed their feelings for him
had changed.</p>

<p>Time sped fast as time does whether joy be coming
or sorrow and all too soon the fatal day arrived.</p>

<p>Dressed in black and pale with fright, the duke
sat expecting the arrival of the devil.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door flew open and the devil, black
as night, stood before him. He paused a moment and
then he said, politely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your time has come, Lord Duke, and I am here
to get you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word the duke arose and followed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
devil to the courtyard, which was filled with a great
multitude of people.</p>

<p>At that moment the shepherd, all out of breath,
came pushing his way through the crowd, and ran
straight at the devil, shouting out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this? Get out of here or
there&rsquo;ll be trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do <em>you</em> mean?&rdquo; whispered the devil.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what I told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; the shepherd whispered back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care anything about the duke. This is to warn you!
You know Katcha? She&rsquo;s alive and she&rsquo;s looking for
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instant the devil heard the name of Katcha
he turned and fled.</p>

<p>All the people cheered the shepherd, while the
shepherd himself laughed in his sleeve to think that
he had taken in the devil so easily.</p>

<p>As for the duke, he was so grateful to the shepherd
that he made him his chief counselor and loved him as
a brother. And well he might, for the shepherd was a
sensible man and always gave him sound advice.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE BETROTHAL GIFTS</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FARMER who had three sons was much troubled
in his mind as to how he should leave his
property. &ldquo;My farm is too small to divide,&rdquo; he kept
thinking to himself. &ldquo;If I divide it into three equal
parts and give each of my sons one part, they will all be
poor cottagers, and yet, if I give it all to one son, I
shall be unjust to the other two. My grandfather
always said that it is a father&rsquo;s duty to treat all his
children alike and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to depart
from his teachings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he called his sons together and said: &ldquo;I
have hit upon a plan whereby fate shall decide which
of you shall be my heir. You must all go out into the
world and find brides, and he who brings back as a
betrothal gift the most beautiful ring shall have the
farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sons agreed to this plan and the next day they
all set out in different directions in quest of brides.</p>

<p>Now the youngest son, whose name was Kubik, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
not considered as bright as his brothers, for he was
kind to beggars and he never drove a hard bargain.
His brothers often laughed at him and his father
pitied him, for he thought that Kubik was too gentle
to make his way in the world.</p>

<p>Kubik&rsquo;s path took him into a deep forest. He
walked on and on until suddenly a little frog hopped
up in front of him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Kubik?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Kubik had never in all his life heard of a frog
that could talk. At first he was frightened but even so
he was too polite not to answer a civil question. So
he told the frog about his father and the farm and the
quest for betrothal gifts upon which he and his brothers
were bound.</p>

<p>The frog listened and when he was finished she said:
&ldquo;Come with me, Kubik, and my daughter, Kachenka,
will give you a more beautiful ring than any your
father or brothers have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kubik hesitated, but at last not to hurt the frog&rsquo;s
feelings he agreed. &ldquo;But if your daughter Kachenka
looks like you,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;Heaven help
me, for she&rsquo;ll be a pretty dear price to pay for a farm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The frog led him to a deep valley at one side of
which rose a high rocky cliff that was honey-combed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
with caverns. The frog hopped into one of these and
called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kachenka, my child, where are you? Here is
Kubik come to woo you and to beg a betrothal gift.
Bring out your little box of rings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly a second frog appeared dragging a heavy
jewel casket. Kachenka, alas, was a hundred times
uglier than her mother. Her legs were crooked, her
face was all covered with spots, and when she spoke
her voice was hoarse and croaking.</p>

<p>For a moment Kubik shivered and turned away in
disgust, but only for a moment until he remembered
that it wasn&rsquo;t Kachenka&rsquo;s fault that she was a frog.</p>

<p>The two frogs put the casket before him and opened
it and Kubik saw that it was filled with a collection of
the rarest and most beautiful rings in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make your own choice, Kubik,&rdquo; the old frog said.</p>

<p>Kubik selected as plain a ring as there was, for
he was ashamed to take one of the handsomest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that one!&rdquo; the old frog said, &ldquo;unless you
want your brothers to laugh at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon she herself picked out the ring that had
the biggest diamond of them all, wrapped it up carefully
in paper, and handed it to Kubik.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now hurry home,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for your brothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
are already there and your father is waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Kubik reached home the farmer called
his three sons together and demanded to be shown
their betrothal gifts.</p>

<p>All the eldest son had was a common brass ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; the farmer said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Well,
put it away for a keepsake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second son showed a silver ring that was worth
a few cents more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little better,&rdquo; the old man mumbled, &ldquo;but not
good enough for a farmer. Put it away for a keepsake.
And now,&rdquo; he said, turning to his youngest son, &ldquo;let
us see what Kubik has brought from his promised
bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all looked at Kubik, and Kubik blushed as
he felt in his pocket for the little package.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; his brothers laughed. &ldquo;Kubik has such
a fine ring that he has to keep it wrapped up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he opened the paper they stopped laughing,
and well they might, for there was a great diamond
that sparkled and blazed until it seemed that the sun
was shining in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kubik!&rdquo; the farmer cried when at last he found
his voice, &ldquo;where did you get that ring? You must
have stolen it, you wicked boy!&rdquo; And without waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
to hear what Kubik had to say, he reached for a whip
and trounced the poor lad to within an inch of his life.
Then he took the ring and hid it carefully away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my boys,&rdquo; he said to his sons, &ldquo;you will all
have to make another trial. This time ask of your
promised brides the gift of an embroidered kerchief
and he who brings back the most beautiful kerchief
shall be my heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next day the three sons again started out,
each in a different direction.</p>

<p>Kubik thought to himself: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go the way I
went yesterday or I may meet that old frog again and
then, when I get home, the only prize I&rsquo;ll get will be
another beating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took a different path but he hadn&rsquo;t gone far
before the old frog hopped up in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Kubik?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>At first Kubik didn&rsquo;t want to tell her but she
questioned him and finally, not to seem rude, he told
her about the beating his father had given him on
account of Kachenka&rsquo;s ring and about the new quest
for embroidered kerchiefs upon which his father was
now sending him and his brothers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t think any more about that whipping,&rdquo;
the old frog advised him. &ldquo;And as for an embroidered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
kerchief, why, Kachenka is the very girl for that! She
will give you one that will make your brothers open
their eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kubik wasn&rsquo;t sure that he wanted to accept another
of Kachenka&rsquo;s gifts, but the old frog urged him and
at last he agreed. So again they took the path to the
rocky cliff. The old frog called her daughter out as
before and presently Kachenka appeared dragging a
chest that was filled with the most wonderful of kerchiefs,
all of fine silk and all richly embroidered and
so large that they were more like shawls than kerchiefs.</p>

<p>Kubik reached in and took the first that came to
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; the old frog said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no way
to select a kerchief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she herself picked out the biggest and the
most richly embroidered of them all and wrapped it
up in paper. She gave it to Kubik and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now hurry home, for your brothers are already
there and your father is waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Kubik reached home the farmer called
his three sons together and demanded to be shown their
betrothal gifts.</p>

<p>All the eldest one had was a small cheap kerchief
of no value whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; the farmer said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Well,
put it away for a keepsake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kerchief of the second had cost a few cents
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little better,&rdquo; the old man mumbled. &ldquo;Perhaps
it&rsquo;s good enough for a farmer. And now,&rdquo; he
said, turning to his youngest son, &ldquo;let us see what
Kubik has brought from his promised bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all looked at Kubik, and Kubik blushed as he
pulled out a parcel from under his shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; his brothers laughed. &ldquo;Kubik has such
a fine kerchief that he has to keep it wrapped up in
paper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when Kubik opened the paper they stopped
laughing, and well they might, for there was a silken
kerchief so big that it could have covered the whole
room and so richly embroidered that any princess in
the world would have been proud to own it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kubik!&rdquo; the farmer cried when at last he was
able to speak, &ldquo;where did you get that kerchief? You
must have stolen it, you wicked boy!&rdquo; And without
waiting to hear what Kubik had to say, he reached
down the whip again and trounced the poor boy to
within an inch of his life. Then he took the kerchief
and hid it carefully away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now, my sons,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will all have to
make another trial. But this time it will not be for a
ring or a kerchief. This time bring home your brides
and he whose bride is the most beautiful shall be my
heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next day the three sons again started out,
each in a different direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see Kachenka again,&rdquo; poor Kubik
said to himself. &ldquo;Twice I&rsquo;ve brought back the best
betrothal gift and each time I&rsquo;ve got a beating for it.
I wonder what they would say if I brought home a
frog for a bride! Then they would have something to
laugh at!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took a different path through the forest but
again he hadn&rsquo;t gone far before the old frog hopped
up in front of him. This time Kubik turned and ran.
The old frog called after him but the louder she called
the faster he ran.</p>

<p>He ran on and on until suddenly a great snake
stopped him. The snake reared high its head, then
dropped into a coil. Again it reared up and swayed
from side to side threatening to strike if Kubik went
on. So Kubik saw that fate was determined that he
should marry a frog and reluctantly he turned back.</p>

<p>The snake led him to the cliff, where the old frog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
greeted him kindly and thanked the snake for his faithful
service.</p>

<p>Poor Kubik! He was very tired and very unhappy.
When you come to think of it, who wouldn&rsquo;t
be unhappy at the prospect of being united for life
to a frog?</p>

<p>Kubik was so tired that presently he fell asleep
and it was just as well he did, for at least in dreams
he could forget his troubles.</p>

<p>The next morning when he woke and rubbed his
eyes, he found himself lying on a soft feather bed,
white as snow, in a splendid room with decorations
that were fit for a king. A fine silken shirt lay spread
out on a chair beside the bed and beyond the chair was
a stand with a silver basin. When he got up attendants
came running in carrying clothes of richly woven cloth
of gold. They dressed Kubik and they combed his
hair until they had him looking like a young prince.
Then they brought him breakfast and there was cream
with the coffee and I would have you know that this
was only the second time in his life that Kubik had ever
had cream with his coffee!</p>

<p>Kubik did not know what to think of it all. His
head went round and round. When he looked out the
window he saw no trace of cliff or caverns or forest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
Instead he saw a big town with streets and houses and
people going to and fro.</p>

<p>Presently music began to play under the window,
a great crowd gathered and soon attendants came in
to escort Lord Kubik out. As he reached the castle
gate, the people cheered and a coach and six drove up.
Two ladies were in it, a mother and daughter, both
dressed in beautiful silks. They alighted from the
coach and when they saw Kubik they smiled and came
toward him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know us, do you, Kubik?&rdquo; the older
lady said. &ldquo;I was that old frog who coaxed you to
the cliff and this, my beautiful daughter, was the other
little frog, the very ugly one, that you feared you
would have to take home to your father&rsquo;s house as
your bride. You see, Kubik, we were all under an
evil enchantment. Many years ago a wicked magician
brought ruin on us and our kingdom. He changed
our subjects into snakes and us into frogs and turned
our fine city into a rocky cliff. Nothing could break
the enchantment until some one should come and ask
a betrothal gift from my daughter. We lived in the
forest for years and years and all those years I begged
all the people who wandered by to help us but they
only trod on us or turned away from us in disgust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
You, Kubik, were the first not to scorn us for our
ugly looks. By this you broke the evil spell that
held us and now we are all free. As a reward you shall
marry my daughter, the Princess Kachenka, and be
made king!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the old queen took Kubik by the hand and
led him to the royal coach, where she made him sit between
her and the princess. Music played and the
people cheered, and in this style they drove to Kubik&rsquo;s
native village and to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>The old man was in the yard chopping firewood
and his older sons were helping him. They, too, had
brought home their brides, plain country girls from
poor farms, and at that moment they were all awaiting
Kubik&rsquo;s arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, father,&rdquo; the oldest son cried, &ldquo;some fine
folk are turning in here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not behind in our taxes, are we?&rdquo; the
second son asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; the old man whispered. &ldquo;I have nothing
to fear. My affairs are all in good order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his cap respectfully under his arm and stood
bareheaded and both his sons followed his example.</p>

<p>The coach drove straight into the yard and a handsome
young lord and two beautiful ladies alighted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
The handsome young lord greeted the old man and his
sons and they bowed and scraped and pressed their
hats under their arms tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>Then they all stepped into the old kitchen that
was black with the smoke of many years and the
handsome young lord sat down on the bench behind
the table as though that was where he always sat. The
two brothers and their brides shrank back against the
oven and held their breath.</p>

<p>Then the handsome young lord said to the old man:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where could I ever have seen your lordship?&rdquo;
the farmer asked, humbly. He kept bobbing so low
it was a wonder he didn&rsquo;t bump his head against the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do neither of your sons know me? I think
these are your sons, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer kept on bowing and the two sons looked
down, too embarrassed to speak.</p>

<p>At length the handsome young lord said: &ldquo;What,
don&rsquo;t you know your own son, Kubik, whom you used
to beat for stealing when he showed you his betrothal
gifts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the old man looked at him closely and
cried out: &ldquo;Bless my soul, I believe it is our Kubik!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
But who could recognize the boy!... And is this
his bride? That settles it! Kubik shall have the farm!
Kubik has brought home the most beautiful bride!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Kubik Greeting His Old Father</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Kubik doesn&rsquo;t need the farm,&rdquo; the old queen
said, &ldquo;nor will you need it any longer nor your other
sons. You will all come home with us to our kingdom
over which Kubik is now king. And may God grant
you many years to live on in peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer was overjoyed at this arrangement.
He embraced his son, and his son&rsquo;s bride, and his son&rsquo;s
royal mother-in-law.</p>

<p>He gave his farm to the poorest man in the village
and then he and his sons accompanied Kubik back
to his kingdom. There he lived long in peace and
comfort enjoying the thought that good fortune had
come to them all on account of his determination not
to divide the farm.</p>

<p>The poor man who inherited the farm prayed for
him and his sons every night and never tired of telling
the story of how Kubik became a king and his brothers
courtiers.</p>

<p>So for many years the memory of Kubik was kept
green. Now people are beginning to forget him, so
I thought it was time that I tell his story again.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">GRANDFATHER&rsquo;S EYES</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a poor boy whom
everybody called Yanechek. His father and
mother were dead and he was forced to start out alone
in the world to make a living. For a long time he
could find nothing to do. He wandered on and on
and at last he came to a little house that stood by
itself near the edge of the woods. An old man sat
on the doorstep and Yanechek could see that he was
blind, for there were empty holes where his eyes used
to be.</p>

<p>Some goats that were penned in a shed near the
house began bleating and the old man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor things, you want to go to pasture,
don&rsquo;t you? But I can&rsquo;t see to drive you and I have
no one else to send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send me, grandfather,&rdquo; Yanechek said. &ldquo;Take
me as your goatherd and let me work for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the old man asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
Yanechek told him who he was and the old man
agreed to take him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;drive the goats to pasture.
But one thing, Yanechek: don&rsquo;t take them to the hill
over there in the woods or the Yezinkas may get you!
That&rsquo;s where they caught me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Yanechek knew that the Yezinkas were
wicked witches who lived in a cave in the woods and
went about in the guise of beautiful young women.
If they met you they would greet you modestly and
say something like &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; to make you
think they were good and kind and then, once they
had you in their power, they would put you to sleep
and gouge out your eyes! Oh, yes, Yanechek knew
about the Yezinkas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear, grandfather, the Yezinkas won&rsquo;t
get me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first day and the second day Yanechek kept
the goats near home. But the third day he said to
himself: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try the hill in the woods.
There&rsquo;s better grass there and I&rsquo;m not afraid of the
Yezinkas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he started out he cut three long slender
switches from a blackberry bramble, wound them into
small coils, and hid them in the crown of his hat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
Then he drove the goats through the woods where they
nibbled at leaves and branches, beside a deep river
where they paused to drink, and up the grassy slopes
of the hill.</p>

<p>There the goats scattered this way and that and
Yanechek sat down on a stone in the shade. He was
hardly seated when he looked up and there before him,
dressed all in white, stood the most beautiful maiden
in the world. Her skin was red as roses and white as
milk, her eyes were black as sloe berries, and her hair,
dark as the raven&rsquo;s wing, fell about her shoulders in
long waving tresses. She smiled and offered Yanechek
a big red apple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, shepherd boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
something for you that grew in my own garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Yanechek knew that she must be a Yezinka
and that, if he ate the apple, he would fall asleep and
then she would gouge out his eyes. So he said,
politely: &ldquo;No, thank you, beautiful maiden. My
master has a tree in his garden with apples that are
bigger than yours and I have eaten as many as I
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the maiden saw that Yanechek was not to
be coaxed, she disappeared.</p>

<p>Presently a second maiden came, more beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
if possible, than the first. In her hand she carried a
lovely red rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, shepherd boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
this a lovely rose? I picked it myself from the hedge.
How fragrant it is! Will you smell it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She offered him the rose but Yanechek refused it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, beautiful maiden. My master&rsquo;s
garden is full of roses much sweeter than yours and I
smell roses all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the second maiden shrugged her shoulders
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Presently a third one came, the youngest and most
beautiful of them all. In her hand she carried a
golden comb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, shepherd boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, beautiful maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at Yanechek and said: &ldquo;Truly you are
a handsome lad, but you would be handsomer still if
your hair were nicely combed. Come, let me comb it
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yanechek said nothing but he took off his hat without
letting the maiden see what was hidden in its
crown. She came up close to him and then, just as
she was about to comb his hair, he whipped out one
of the long blackberry switches and struck her over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
the hands. She screamed and tried to escape but she
could not because it is the fate of a Yezinka not to
be able to move if ever a human being strikes her
over the hands with a switch of bramble.</p>

<p>So Yanechek took her two hands and bound them
together with the long thorny switch while she wept
and struggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help, sisters! Help!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>At that the two other Yezinkas came running and
when they saw what had happened they, too, began
to weep and to beg Yanechek to unbind their sister&rsquo;s
hands and let her go.</p>

<p>But Yanechek only laughed and said: &ldquo;No. You
unbind them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Yanechek, how can we? Our hands are soft
and the thorns will prick us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, when they saw that Yanechek was not to
be moved, they went to their sister and tried to help
her. Whereupon Yanechek whipped out the other two
blackberry switches and struck them also on their soft
pretty hands, first one and then the other. After that
they, too, could not move and it was easy enough to
bind them and make them prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got the three of you, you wicked
Yezinkas!&rdquo; Yanechek said. &ldquo;It was you who gouged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
out my poor old master&rsquo;s eyes, you know it was! And
you shall not escape until you do as I ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left them there and ran home to his master to
whom he said: &ldquo;Come, grandfather, for I have found
a means of restoring your eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the old man by the hand and led him
through the woods, along the bank of the river, and
up the grassy hillside where the three Yezinkas were
still struggling and weeping.</p>

<p>Then he said to the first of them: &ldquo;Tell me now
where my master&rsquo;s eyes are. If you don&rsquo;t tell me,
I&rsquo;ll throw you into the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first Yezinka pretended she didn&rsquo;t know. So
Yanechek lifted her up and started down the hill
toward the river.</p>

<p>That frightened the maiden and she cried out:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw me into the river, Yanechek, and I&rsquo;ll
find you your master&rsquo;s eyes, I promise you I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Yanechek put her down and she led him to a
cave in the hillside where she and her wicked sisters
had piled up a great heap of eyes&mdash;all kinds of eyes
they were: big eyes, little eyes, black eyes, red eyes,
blue eyes, green eyes&mdash;every kind of eye in the world
that you can think of.</p>

<p>She went to the heap and picked out two eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
which she said were the right ones. But when the
poor old man tried to look through them, he cried out
in fright:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see nothing but dark treetops with sleeping
birds and flying bats! These are not my eyes! They
are owls&rsquo; eyes! Take them out! Take them out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Yanechek saw how the first Yezinka had
deceived him, without another word he picked her up,
threw her into the river, and that was the end of her.</p>

<p>Then he said to the second sister: &ldquo;Now you tell
me where my master&rsquo;s eyes are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first she, too, pretended she didn&rsquo;t know, but
when Yanechek threatened to throw her likewise into
the river, she was glad enough to lead him back to the
cave and pick out two eyes that she said were the right
ones.</p>

<p>But when the poor old man tried to look through
them, again he cried out in fright: &ldquo;I see nothing but
tangled underbrush and snapping teeth and hot red
tongues! These are not my eyes! They are wolves&rsquo;
eyes! Take them out! Take them out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Yanechek saw how the second Yezinka had
deceived him, without another word he picked her up,
and threw her also into the river, and that was the end
of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
Then Yanechek said to the third sister: &ldquo;Now you
tell me where my master&rsquo;s eyes are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first she, too, pretended she didn&rsquo;t know, but
when Yanechek threatened to throw her likewise into
the river, she was glad enough to lead him to the cave
and pick out two eyes that she said were the right
ones.</p>

<p>But when the poor old man tried to look through
them, again he cried out in fright: &ldquo;I see nothing
but swirling waters and flashing fins! These are not
my eyes! They are fishes&rsquo; eyes! Take them out!
Take them out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Yanechek saw how the third Yezinka had
deceived him, without another word he was ready to
serve her as he had served her sisters. But she begged
him not to drown her and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try again, Yanechek, and I&rsquo;ll find you the
right eyes, I promise you I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Yanechek let her try again and from the very
bottom of the heap she picked out two more eyes that
she swore were the right ones.</p>

<p>When the old man looked through them, he clapped
his hands and said: &ldquo;These are my own eyes, praise
God! Now I can see as well as ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that the old man and Yanechek lived on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
happily together. Yanechek pastured the goats and the
old man made cheeses at home and they ate them together.
And you may be sure that the third Yezinka
never showed herself again on that hill!</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">RATTLE-RATTLE-RATTLE AND CHINK-CHINK-CHINK</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a poor man whose wife died
leaving him a daughter. The little girl&rsquo;s name
was Lenka. She was a good little girl, cheerful and
obedient and very industrious, and she did all she
could to make her father comfortable.</p>

<p>After some time the man married again. His
second wife also had a little girl just Lenka&rsquo;s age.
Her name was Dorla. Dorla was a lazy, ill-natured
child, always quarreling and bickering. Yet her
mother thought Dorla was perfect and she was always
praising her to her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what a good child my Dorla is,&rdquo; she would
say to him. &ldquo;She works and spins and never says a
cross word. Very different from your good-for-nothing
Lenka who always breaks everything she touches
and does nothing in return for all the good food she
eats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She never stopped nagging and scolding her poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
stepchild and complaining about her to her husband.
Lenka was patient and went on quietly doing what
was right, and she was always polite to her stepmother,
and kind to her ill-natured stepsister.</p>

<p>She and Dorla used to go to spinning bees together.
Dorla would play and waste her time and hardly fill
one spindle. Lenka always worked industriously and
usually filled two or three spools. Yet, when the two
girls got home, the mother always took Dorla&rsquo;s half-filled
spindle and said to the father: &ldquo;See what
beautiful yarn my Dorla spins!&rdquo; She would hide
Lenka&rsquo;s spools and say: &ldquo;Your Lenka did nothing but
play and waste her time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And before other people she talked the same way,
pretending Dorla did everything that she didn&rsquo;t do
and saying that good industrious Lenka was lazy and
good-for-nothing.</p>

<p>One night when the two girls were walking home
together from a spinning bee, they came to a ditch in
the road. Dorla jumped quickly across and then
reached back her hand and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sister, let me hold your spindle. You
may fall and hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Lenka, suspecting nothing unkind, handed
Dorla her full spindle. Dorla took it and ran home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
and then boasted to her mother and her stepfather
how much she had spun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lenka,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has no yarn at all. She did
nothing but play and waste her time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the woman to her husband. &ldquo;This
is what I&rsquo;m always telling you but you never believe
me. That Lenka of yours is a lazy, good-for-nothing
girl who expects me and my poor daughter to do all
the work. I&rsquo;m not going to stand her in the house
any longer. Tomorrow morning out she goes to make
her own way in the world. Then perhaps she&rsquo;ll understand
what a good home she&rsquo;s had with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor man tried to defend Lenka but his wife
would hear nothing. Lenka must go and that was all
there was to it.</p>

<p>Early the next morning while it was still dark the
woman started Lenka off. She gave her a sack that
she said was full of good meal and smoked meat and
bread. But instead of meal she put in ashes, instead
of smoked meat straw, and instead of bread
stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is meal and smoked meat and bread for
your journey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will be a long time
finding any one who will be as good to you as I have
been! Now be off with you and never let me see you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
again! Let your father put you out in service if he
can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor man put his ax on his shoulder and
started off with Lenka. He had no place to take her
and he hardly knew what to do. He led her off into
the mountains, where he built her a little two-room
hut. He was ashamed to tell her that he was going
to leave her alone, so he said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stay here, my dear child, while I go farther
into the forest and cut you some firewood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But instead of cutting her firewood, he hung his
mallet on a beech tree and whenever the wind blew,
the mallet made a knocking sound. All afternoon
poor little Lenka hearing the knock-knock of the mallet
thought to herself: &ldquo;There is my dear father chopping
wood for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When evening came and he hadn&rsquo;t returned, Lenka
went out to find him, but all she could find was the
mallet going knock-knock on the tree. Then the poor
girl realized that her father had deceived her but she
forgave him, for she knew that it was her stepmother&rsquo;s
fault.</p>

<p>She went back to the little hut to get her supper,
but when she opened the sack her stepmother had
given her, instead of meal and smoked meat and bread,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
she found only ashes and straw and stones. Then
indeed did Lenka feel deserted and sitting down she
cried with loneliness and hunger.</p>

<p>While she was crying an old beggar with a long
beard came into the hut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God grant you happiness, my child,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May He grant you the same, old father,&rdquo; Lenka
said, standing up and bowing politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my child, thank you. And now will
you be so kind as to wash my face and give me a bite
of supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, old father, I&rsquo;d gladly wash your face
and give you food, but there&rsquo;s no water here and nothing
to carry it in. And as for food, my stepmother
filled the sack with ashes, straw, and stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing, my child. Just go behind the
hut and you will find a spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lenka went and there, sure enough, was a clear
bubbling spring and on the ground beside it a bucket.
She filled the bucket and carried it back to the
hut.</p>

<p>As she entered the door she could hardly believe
her eyes, for on the wall she saw a row of shining
plates, big plates and little plates, and cups, and everything
else that ought to be in a kitchen. The old beggar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
had started a fire, so Lenka at once put on water
to boil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in the sack,&rdquo; the beggar said.</p>

<p>Lenka untied the sack again and here it was full
of fine meal and bread and smoked meat!</p>

<p>So now Lenka lost no time in preparing a good
supper. Then she washed the old beggar&rsquo;s face and
hands and together they ate. After supper Lenka
spread out her ragged clothes on the floor of the
inner room and put the beggar in there for the night.
She herself stretched out on the kitchen bench. It was
a hard bed but Lenka made no complaint and presently
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>At midnight there was a knocking at the door and
a voice called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>A man am I</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Six inches high,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But a long, long beard</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hangs from my chin.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Open the door</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And let me in!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lenka jumped down and opened the door and
there before her stood a tiny dwarf with a long beard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
He was Long Beard who lived in the mountains and
of whom Lenka had often heard stories.</p>

<p>He came in dragging after him a heavy bag of
golden ducats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was that old beggar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whose face you
washed and with whom you shared your supper. These
ducats are to reward you for your kindness. Now go
into your bedroom and lie down comfortably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this he vanished.</p>

<p>Lenka went into her bedroom and there, instead of
her few rags on the floor, was a fine feather bed and
coverlets and a painted chest full of clothes. Lenka
lay down on the feather bed and instantly fell asleep.</p>

<p>On the third day her father came, supposing by
that time Lenka had either died of hunger or been
devoured by wild beasts. At least, he thought, he
would gather together her bones.</p>

<p>But when he reached the hut he rubbed his eyes
in surprise. Instead of the rough hut, there was a
pretty little cottage and instead of a handful of bones
there was a happy girl singing away at her spinning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter, my daughter!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, dear father. You couldn&rsquo;t have found
a better place for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
She told him how happy she was and how pleasantly
she passed the time, spinning and singing and
working. Then she took a table-cloth and filled it
with golden ducats and gave it to him.</p>

<p>So he went away very happy, thanking God for
the good fortune that had come to Lenka.</p>

<p>As he neared home, the old dog that lay at the door
said to the stepmother:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow-wow, mistress, here comes the master. It&rsquo;s
chink-chink the money before him and chink-chink the
money behind him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, old dog!&rdquo; the stepmother cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
rattle-rattle bones before him and rattle-rattle bones
behind him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when the man came into the cottage, he said:
&ldquo;Wife, give me a basket and let me empty this table-cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you expect me to give
you a basket for your daughter&rsquo;s bones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he began to chink the golden ducats and then
she got a basket fast enough.</p>

<p>When she had all the ducats safely put away she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just like you to find a place like that for
your Lenka! But what have you ever done for my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
poor Dorla? Tomorrow you will take her out into the
world and find a good place for her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she got ready for Dorla a fine new bed and
stylish clothes and as much good food as she could
carry. The next day the man took Dorla out into
the mountains and built her a little hut of two rooms.</p>

<p>Dorla sat in the hut and thought about the good
supper she was going to cook for herself.</p>

<p>In the evening the same old beggar came and said
to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God grant you happiness, my child. Won&rsquo;t
you please wash my face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wash your face, indeed!&rdquo; cried Dorla in a rage.
&ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;ll do to you!&rdquo; And she took a stick
and drove the old beggar away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Very well! Very
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dorla cooked herself a fine supper. After
she had eaten every bite of it herself, she lay down on
the bed and went soundly to sleep.</p>

<p>At midnight Long Beard knocked at the door and
called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>A man am I</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Six inches high,</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But a long, long beard</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hangs from my chin.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Open the door</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And let me in!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Dorla was very frightened and she hid in the
corner. Long Beard broke open the door and he
caught Dorla and he shook her out of her skin. It
served her right, too, for she was a wicked, spiteful
girl and she had never been kind to anybody in her
life.</p>

<p>Long Beard left her bones in a heap on the floor,
and he hung her skin on the nail at the back of the
door. Then he put her grinning skull in the window.</p>

<p>On the third day Dorla&rsquo;s mother gave her husband
a brand new table-cloth and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go now and see how my Dorla is getting on.
Here is a table-cloth for the ducats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man took the table-cloth and went to the
mountains. As he came near the hut, he saw something
in the window that looked like grinning teeth.
He said to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dorla must be very happy to be smiling at me
from this distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he reached the hut all he found of Dorla
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
was a heap of bones on the floor, the skin hanging on
the nail behind the door, and the skull grinning in the
window.</p>

<p>Without a word he gathered the bones into the
table-cloth and started back.</p>

<p>As he neared home the old dog said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow-wow, mistress, here comes the master and
it&rsquo;s rattle-rattle before him and rattle-rattle behind
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, old dog!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s chink-chink
before him, and chink-chink behind him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the old dog kept on barking and saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, bow-wow, it&rsquo;s rattle-rattle before him and
rattle-rattle behind him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a rage the woman took a stick and beat the dog.</p>

<p>Then the man stepped into the cottage and at once
his wife brought out a basket for the ducats. But
when he shook out the table-cloth there was only the
rattle-rattle of bones.</p>

<h2>THE BIRD WITH THE GOLDEN GIZZARD</h2>

<p class="center">THE STORY OF TWO BROTHERS</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE BIRD WITH THE GOLDEN GIZZARD</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a poor man who had a large family.
He was so poor that he had nothing to feed
the children. For three days they had had no food.
On the third day as the father was out cutting osiers
he saw, sitting in a bush, a small bird that shone like
gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could snare that bird,&rdquo; he thought to himself,
&ldquo;and take it home, the children would be amused
and perhaps forget they were hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he caught the bird and carried it home and, sure
enough, the children were so delighted that for two
days they didn&rsquo;t cry for food.</p>

<p>On the third day the bird laid a golden egg. The
oldest boy took the egg to the goldsmith to sell it.
The goldsmith examined it and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have money enough to buy this
egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just give me some bread,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;That
will be enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
The goldsmith gave him two loaves of bread, one
under each arm, and filled his pockets with golden
ducats. So for once the whole family had all it could
eat and still there was money left over.</p>

<p>Two days later the bird laid another golden egg
which the boy carried to the goldsmith and sold for
the same price.</p>

<p>Now the goldsmith had a son who said he would
like to see this wonderful bird. So he went home
with the boy. He looked the bird over very carefully
and under its wings he discovered an inscription that
no one else had seen. The inscription read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Whoever eats my heart will become king.</i></p>

<p><i>Whoever eats my gizzard will find under his head
each morning a heap of golden ducats.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The youth went home and told his father about
the strange inscription. They talked the matter over
and at last decided that it would be well for the young
man to marry the poor man&rsquo;s oldest daughter provided
he could get the golden bird as dowry.</p>

<p>The goldsmith went to see the girl&rsquo;s father and
after some discussion the marriage was arranged.</p>

<p>The wedding day arrived. The bridegroom ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
the bird to be roasted and ready to be put on the table
when the bridal party came home from church. It was
his intention to eat the heart himself and have his
bride eat the gizzard.</p>

<p>The children of the family cried bitterly at the
thought of losing their pretty bird, but the bridegroom,
of course, had his way.</p>

<p>Now two of the boys stayed home from the wedding
and they decided that they would like very much to
taste the roast bird if only they could find a piece
that nobody would miss. They did not dare take a
leg or a wing, but they thought it would be safe to
pick out a morsel from the inside. So one boy ate
the heart, the other the gizzard. Then they were so
frightened at what they had done that they ran away
and never came back.</p>

<p>When the bride and groom returned from church,
the bird was carried to the table. The groom looked
at once for the heart and the gizzard and was greatly
shocked at their disappearance.</p>

<p>The two boys who had gone out into the world
found work with a merchant. They slept together
and every morning the merchant&rsquo;s wife found a heap
of golden ducats under the feather bed. She didn&rsquo;t
know to which boy they belonged. She took them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
saved them for a whole year until they filled a hogshead.</p>

<p>At the end of a year the boys decided to go out
again into the world. The merchant showed them all
the ducats his wife had found in their bed and he
said to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take with you as many as you want now and
when you come back you may have the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers parted company and each set out
alone, the one to the left, the other to the right.</p>

<p>The younger brother came to a tavern. The landlady
had two daughters who were so sharp at cards
that they very soon won all the money he had. When
he was picked clean he asked them to stop playing
until the next morning when he would again have
plenty of money.</p>

<p>Sure enough in the morning when he got up he
had all the money he wanted. The girls asked him
where it came from and he told them.</p>

<p>When they heard about the gizzard he had swallowed,
they put something in his wine that made him
sick at his stomach and he threw up the gizzard. The
younger girl instantly snatched it, washed it, and swallowed
it herself. Then as he had no more money they
drove the poor boy away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
As he wandered in the fields he grew very hungry.
He came to a meadow where he found a kind of sorrel
that he ate. As soon as he ate it he turned into a
goat and went jumping about the bushes nibbling at
the leaves. He chanced to eat a kind of leaf that
changed him back into himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;now I know what to do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked some of the sorrel and some of the other
leaves and went straight back to the tavern. He told
them there that he was bringing them a present of a
new kind of spinach that tasted very good. They
asked him would he cook it for them.</p>

<p>The cook tasted it and at once she turned into a
goat. The serving maid came into the kitchen and
when she saw a goat there she drove it out. The youth
asked the maid would she like to taste the new spinach.
She tasted it and immediately she turned into a goat.
Then when the landlady and her two daughters tasted
it they, too, turned into goats.</p>

<p>He fed the cook and the serving maid some of the
other leaves and they turned back into themselves.
But the other three he left as goats.</p>

<p>He made halters for them and then he hitched
them up and drove off.</p>

<p>He drove on and on until he came to a town where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
the king was building himself a castle. Now this king
was his brother who had eaten the magic bird&rsquo;s heart.
The king&rsquo;s workmen were hauling stone for the new
castle, so he decided to put his goats to work hauling
stone. He loaded his cart heavier than all the other
carts.</p>

<p>The king noticed him and recognized him and asked
him where he got those goats. So he told the king
the whole story. The king thought the goats had
been punished long enough and begged his brother to
have pity on them and restore them. He took the
king&rsquo;s advice and did so.</p>

<p>When they were once more human beings, he
married the girl who had swallowed the gizzard. They
soon became very rich, for every morning there was a
heap of golden ducats under her head.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ETUSHKA was a little girl. Her mother was
a poor widow with nothing but a tumble-down
cottage and two little nanny-goats. But poor as they
were Betushka was always cheerful. From spring till
autumn she pastured the goats in the birch wood.
Every morning when she left home her mother gave
her a little basket with a slice of bread and a spindle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that you bring home a full spindle,&rdquo; her
mother always said.</p>

<p>Betushka had no distaff, so she wound the flax
around her head. Then she took the little basket
and went romping and singing behind the goats to the
birch wood. When they got there she sat down under
a tree and pulled the fibers of the flax from her head
with her left hand, and with her right hand let down
the spindle so that it went humming along the ground.
All the while she sang until the woods echoed and the
little goats nibbled away at the leaves and grass.</p>

<p>When the sun showed midday, she put the spindle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
aside, called the goats and gave them a mouthful of
bread so that they wouldn&rsquo;t stray, and ran off into the
woods to hunt berries or any other wild fruit that
was in season. Then when she had finished her bread
and fruit, she jumped up, folded her arms, and danced
and sang.</p>

<p>The sun smiled at her through the green of the
trees and the little goats, resting on the grass, thought:
&ldquo;What a merry little shepherdess we have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After her dance she went back to her spinning and
worked industriously. In the evening when she got
home her mother never had to scold her because the
spindle was empty.</p>

<p>One day at noon just after she had eaten and, as
usual, was going to dance, there suddenly stood before
her a most beautiful maiden. She was dressed in
white gauze that was fine as a spider&rsquo;s web. Long
golden hair fell down to her waist and on her head
she wore a wreath of woodland flowers.</p>

<p>Betushka was speechless with surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>The maiden smiled at her and said in a sweet
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betushka, do you like to dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her manner was so gracious that Betushka no
longer felt afraid, and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, I could dance all day long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, then, let us dance together,&rdquo; said the
maiden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she tucked up her skirt, put her arm
about Betushka&rsquo;s waist, and they began to dance. At
once such enchanting music sounded over their heads
that Betushka&rsquo;s heart went one-two with the dancing.
The musicians sat on the branches of the birch trees.
They were clad in little frock coats, black and gray
and many-colored. It was a carefully chosen orchestra
that had gathered at the bidding of the beautiful
maiden: larks, nightingales, finches, linnets, thrushes,
blackbirds, and showy mocking-birds.</p>

<p>Betushka&rsquo;s cheeks burned, her eyes shone. She
forgot her spinning, she forgot her goats. All she
could do was gaze at her partner who was moving with
such grace and lightness that the grass didn&rsquo;t seem to
bend under her slender feet.</p>

<p>They danced from noon till sundown and yet Betushka
wasn&rsquo;t the least bit tired. Then they stopped
dancing, the music ceased, and the maiden disappeared
as suddenly as she had come.</p>

<p>Betushka looked around. The sun was sinking
behind the wood. She put her hands to the unspun
flax on her head and remembered the spindle that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
lying unfilled on the grass. She took down the flax
and laid it with the spindle in the little basket. Then
she called the goats and started home.</p>

<p>She reproached herself bitterly that she had allowed
the beautiful maiden to beguile her and she
told herself that another time she would not listen
to her. She was so quiet that the little goats, missing
her merry song, looked around to see whether it was
really their own little shepherdess who was following
them. Her mother, too, wondered why she didn&rsquo;t
sing and questioned her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sick, Betushka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear mother, I&rsquo;m not sick, but I&rsquo;ve been
singing too much and my throat is dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that her mother did not reel the yarn
at once, so she hid the spindle and the unspun flax,
hoping to make up tomorrow what she had not done
today. She did not tell her mother one word about
the beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>The next day she felt cheerful again and as she
drove the goats to pasture she sang merrily. At the
birch wood she sat down to her spinning, singing all
the while, for with a song on the lips work falls from
the hands more easily.</p>

<p>Noonday came. Betushka gave a bit of bread to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
each of the goats and ran off to the woods for her
berries. Then she ate her luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my little goats,&rdquo; she sighed, as she brushed
up the crumbs for the birds, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t dance today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why mustn&rsquo;t you dance today?&rdquo; a sweet voice
asked, and there stood the beautiful maiden as though
she had fallen from the clouds.</p>

<p>Betushka was worse frightened than before and
she closed her eyes tight. When the maiden repeated
her question, Betushka answered timidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, beautiful lady, for not dancing with
you. If I dance with you I cannot spin my stint
and then my mother will scold me. Today before the
sun sets I must make up for what I lost yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, child, and dance,&rdquo; the maiden said. &ldquo;Before
the sun sets we&rsquo;ll find some way of getting that
spinning done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tucked up her skirt, put her arm about Betushka,
the musicians in the treetops struck up, and off
they whirled. The maiden danced more beautifully
than ever. Betushka couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes from her.
She forgot her goats, she forgot her spinning. All she
wanted to do was to dance on forever.</p>

<p>At sundown the maiden paused and the music
stopped. Then Betushka, clasping her hands to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
head, where the unspun flax was twined, burst into
tears. The beautiful maiden took the flax from her
head, wound it round the stem of a slender birch,
grasped the spindle, and began to spin. The spindle
hummed along the ground and filled in no time. Before
the sun sank behind the woods all the flax was
spun, even that which was left over from the day before.
The maiden handed Betushka the full spindle
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember my words:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Reel and grumble not!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Reel and grumble not!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she said this, she vanished as if the earth
had swallowed her.</p>

<p>Betushka was very happy now and she thought to
herself on her way home: &ldquo;Since she is so good and
kind, I&rsquo;ll dance with her again if she asks me. Oh,
how I hope she does!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sang her merry little song as usual and the
goats trotted cheerfully along.</p>

<p>She found her mother vexed with her, for she had
wanted to reel yesterday&rsquo;s yarn and had discovered
that the spindle was not full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
&ldquo;What were you doing yesterday,&rdquo; she scolded,
&ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t spin your stint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betushka hung her head. &ldquo;Forgive me, mother.
I danced too long.&rdquo; Then she showed her mother
today&rsquo;s spindle and said: &ldquo;See, today I more than
made up for yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother said no more but went to milk the
goats and Betushka put away the spindle. She wanted
to tell her mother her adventure, but she thought to
herself: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll wait. If the beautiful lady comes
again, I&rsquo;ll ask her who she is and then I&rsquo;ll tell mother.&rdquo;
So she said nothing.</p>

<p>On the third morning she drove the goats as usual
to the birch wood. The goats went to pasture and
Betushka, sitting down under a tree, began to spin
and sing. When the sun pointed to noon, she laid her
spindle on the grass, gave the goats a mouthful of
bread, gathered some strawberries, ate her luncheon,
and then, giving the crumbs to the birds, she said
cheerily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, my little goats, I will dance for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She jumped up, folded her arms, and was about
to see whether she could move as gracefully as the
beautiful maiden, when the maiden herself stood before
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let us dance together,&rdquo; she said. She smiled
at Betushka, put her arm about her, and as the music
above their heads began to play, they whirled round
and round with flying feet. Again Betushka forgot
the spindle and the goats. Again she saw nothing but
the beautiful maiden whose body was lithe as a willow
shoot. Again she heard nothing but the enchanting
music to which her feet danced of themselves.</p>

<p>They danced from noon till sundown. Then the
maiden paused and the music ceased. Betushka looked
around. The sun was already set behind the woods.
She clasped her hands to her head and looking down
at the unfilled spindle she burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what will my mother say?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your little basket,&rdquo; the maiden said,
&ldquo;and I will put something in it that will more than
make up for today&rsquo;s stint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betushka handed her the basket and the maiden
took it and vanished. In a moment she was back.
She returned the basket and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Look not inside until you&rsquo;re home!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Look not inside until you&rsquo;re home!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As she said these words she was gone as if a wind
had blown her away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
Betushka wanted awfully to peep inside but she
was afraid to. The basket was so light that she
wondered whether there was anything at all in it.
Was the lovely lady only fooling her? Halfway home
she peeped in to see.</p>

<p>Imagine her feelings when she found the basket
was full of birch leaves! Then indeed did Betushka
burst into tears and reproach herself for being so
simple. In her vexation she threw out a handful of
leaves and was going to empty the basket when she
thought to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll keep what&rsquo;s left as litter for the goats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was almost afraid to go home. She was so
quiet that again the little goats wondered what ailed
their shepherdess.</p>

<p>Her mother was waiting for her in great excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Betushka, what kind of a spool
did you bring home yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Betushka faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you went away this morning I started to
reel that yarn. I reeled and reeled and the spool remained
full. One skein, two skeins, three skeins, and
still the spool was full. &lsquo;What evil spirit has spun
that?&rsquo; I cried out impatiently, and instantly the yarn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
disappeared from the spindle as if blown away. Tell
me, what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Betushka confessed and told her mother all she
knew about the beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried her mother in amazement, &ldquo;that was
a wood maiden! At noon and midnight the wood
maidens dance. It is well you are not a little boy or
she might have danced you to death! But they are
often kind to little girls and sometimes make them
rich presents. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? If I hadn&rsquo;t
grumbled, I could have had yarn enough to fill the
house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betushka thought of the little basket and wondered
if there might be something under the leaves. She
took out the spindle and unspun flax and looked in
once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come here and see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother looked and clapped her hands. The
birch leaves were all turned to gold!</p>

<p>Betushka reproached herself bitterly: &ldquo;She told
me not to look inside until I got home, but I didn&rsquo;t
obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you didn&rsquo;t empty the whole basket,&rdquo;
her mother said.</p>

<p>The next morning she herself went to look for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
handful of leaves that Betushka had thrown away.
She found them still lying in the road but they were
only birch leaves.</p>

<p>But the riches which Betushka brought home were
enough. Her mother bought a farm with fields and
cattle. Betushka had pretty clothes and no longer
had to pasture goats.</p>

<p>But no matter what she did, no matter how cheerful
and happy she was, still nothing ever again gave
her quite so much pleasure as the dance with the
wood maiden. She often went to the birch wood in
the hope of seeing the maiden again. But she never
did.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a poor woman who had twin
daughters. The girls were exactly alike in face
and feature but utterly different in disposition. Dobrunka
was kind, industrious, obedient, and everything
a good girl ought to be. Zloboha, her sister, was
spiteful, disobedient, lazy, and proud. In fact, she
had just about as many faults as a person could
have. Yet strange to say the mother loved Zloboha
much better and made everything easy for her.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Alike in Feature but Utterly Different in Disposition</i></p>

<p>They lived in a cottage a few miles from town.
The cottage stood by itself in a little clearing in the
woods. Hardly any one ever passed it except occasionally
some man who had lost his way in the woods.</p>

<p>The mother put her favorite, Zloboha, out to service
so that she might learn city ways, but she kept
Dobrunka at home to do the housework and take care
of the garden. Dobrunka always began the day by
feeding the goats, then she prepared the breakfast,
swept the kitchen, and when everything else was done
she sat down at her spinning wheel and spun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
She seldom benefited from the yarn she spun so
carefully, for her mother always sold it in town and
spent the money on clothes for Zloboha. Yet Dobrunka
loved her mother although she never had a
kind word or a kind look from her the whole day
long. She always obeyed her mother instantly and
without a frown and no one ever heard her complain
about all the work she had to do.</p>

<p>One day when her mother was going to town
Dobrunka went part of the way with her, carrying
her yarn wrapped up in a kerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see that you&rsquo;re not lazy while I&rsquo;m away,&rdquo;
her mother said, crossly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, mother, you never have to nag at
me. Today when I finish the housework, I&rsquo;ll spin so
industriously that you&rsquo;ll be more than satisfied when
you get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She handed her yarn to her mother and went back
to the cottage. Then when she had put the kitchen
in order, she sat down to her wheel and began to
spin. Dobrunka had a pretty voice, as pretty as any
of the song-birds in the forest, and always when she
was alone she sang. So today as she sat spinning
she sang all the songs she knew, one after the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard outside the trample of a horse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some one is coming,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;someone
who has lost his way in the woods. I&rsquo;ll go see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up from her wheel and peeped out through
the small window. A young man was just dismounting
from a spirited horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Dobrunka to herself, &ldquo;what a
handsome young lord he is! How well his leather coat
fits him! How well his cap with its white feather
looks on his black hair! Ah, he is tying his horse and
is coming in. I must slip back to my spinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment the young man opened the door
and stepped into the kitchen. All this happened a
long time ago, you see, when there were no locks or
bars on the doors, and there didn&rsquo;t have to be because
nothing was ever stolen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, my girl,&rdquo; the young man said
to Dobrunka.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; Dobrunka answered. &ldquo;What is
it, sir, you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please get me a little water. I&rsquo;m very
thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Dobrunka said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit
down while I&rsquo;m getting it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran off, got the pitcher, rinsed it out, and
drew some fresh water from the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish I could give you something better, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing could taste better than this,&rdquo; he said,
handing her back the empty pitcher. &ldquo;See, I have
taken it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka put the pitcher away and the young
man, while her back was turned, slipped a leather
bag, full of money, into the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for the drink,&rdquo; he said, as he rose
to go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come if you want to,&rdquo; Dobrunka said, modestly.</p>

<p>He took her hand, held it a moment, then leaped
upon his horse and galloped off.</p>

<p>Dobrunka sat down again to her wheel and tried
to work, but her mind wandered. The image of the
young man kept rising before her eyes and I have to
confess that, for an expert spinner, she broke her
thread pretty often.</p>

<p>Her mother came home in the evening full of
praises of Zloboha, who, she said, was growing prettier
day by day. Everybody in town admired her and
she was fast learning city ways and city manners.
It was Zloboha this and Zloboha that for hours.</p>

<p>Finally the old woman remarked: &ldquo;They say
there was a great hunting party out today. Did you
hear anything of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Dobrunka said. &ldquo;I forgot to tell you
that a young huntsman stopped here to ask for a
drink. He was handsomely dressed in leather. You
know once when I was in town with you we saw a
whole company of men in leather coats with white
feathers in their caps. No doubt this young man belonged
to the hunting party. When he had his drink,
he jumped on his horse and rode off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka forgot to mention that he had taken
her hand in parting and promised to come back next
day.</p>

<p>When Dobrunka was preparing the bed for the
night, the bag of money fell out. In great surprise
she picked it up and handed it to her mother.</p>

<p>The old woman looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dobrunka, who gave you all this money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody gave it to me, mother. Perhaps the
huntsman slipped it into the bed. I don&rsquo;t know where
else it could have come from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman emptied the bag on the table.
They were all gold pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, so much!&rdquo; she murmured in
amazement. &ldquo;He must be a very rich young lord!
Perhaps he saw how poor we were and thought to do
a kind deed. May God grant him happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
She gathered the money together and hid it in the
chest.</p>

<p>Usually when Dobrunka went to bed after her
day&rsquo;s work she fell asleep at once, but tonight she
lay awake thinking of the handsome young rider.
When she did at last fall asleep it was to dream of
him. He was a powerful young lord, it seemed to
her, in her dream. He lived in a great palace and
she, Dobrunka, was his wife. She thought that they
were giving a fine banquet to which all the nobles in
the land had been invited. She and her husband arose
from the table and went together into another room.
He was about to put his arms about her and embrace
her when suddenly a black cat sprang between them
and buried its claws in Dobrunka&rsquo;s breast. Her
heart&rsquo;s blood spurted out and stained her white dress.
She cried out in fright and pain and the cry awoke
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a strange dream,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
&ldquo;I wonder what it means. It began so beautifully
but the cruel cat spoiled it all. I fear it bodes something
ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning when she got up, she was still
thinking of it.</p>

<p>On other mornings it didn&rsquo;t take Dobrunka long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
to dress but this morning she was very slow. She
shook out her fresh skirt again and again. She had
the greatest trouble in putting on her bodice just
right. She spent much time on her hair, into which
she plaited the red ribbon that she usually kept for
holidays. When at last she was dressed and ready
to go about her household duties she looked very
fresh and sweet.</p>

<p>As midday came, she found it hard to sit still at her
wheel, but kept jumping up on any pretext whatever
to run outdoors a moment to see if the young horseman
was in sight.</p>

<p>At last she did see him at a distance and, oh, how
she hurried back to her stool so that he would never
think that she was watching for him.</p>

<p>He rode into the yard, tied his horse, and came into
the cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Dobrunka,&rdquo; he said, speaking very
gently and very respectfully.</p>

<p>Dobrunka&rsquo;s heart was beating so fast that she
feared it would jump out of her body. Her mother
was in the woods gathering fagots, so she was again
alone with him. She managed to return his greeting
and to ask him to sit down. Then she went back to
her spinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
The young man came over to her and took her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you sleep, Dobrunka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a very strange dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it. I can explain dreams very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t tell this dream to you,&rdquo; Dobrunka
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very reason you ought to tell me,&rdquo;
the young man said.</p>

<p>He urged her and begged her until at last Dobrunka
did tell him the dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that dream of yours except
the part about the cat can be realized easily enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka laughed. &ldquo;How could I ever become a
fine lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By marrying me,&rdquo; the young man said.</p>

<p>Dobrunka blushed. &ldquo;Now, sir, you are joking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Dobrunka, this is no joke. I really mean
it. I came back this morning to ask you to marry
me. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
Dobrunka was too surprised to speak, but when
the young man took her hand she did not withdraw it.</p>

<p>Just then the old woman came in. The young
man greeted her and without any delay declared his
intentions. He said he loved Dobrunka and wished
to make her his wife and that all he and Dobrunka
were waiting for was the mother&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my own house,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and am well
able to take care of a wife. And for you too, dear
mother, there will always be room in my house and
at my table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman listened to all he had to say and
then very promptly gave her blessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear one,&rdquo; the young man said to
Dobrunka, &ldquo;go back to your spinning and when you
have spun enough for your wedding shift, I shall
come for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her, gave his hand to her mother, and,
springing on his horse, rode away.</p>

<p>From that time the old woman treated Dobrunka
more kindly. She even went so far as to spend on
Dobrunka a little of the money the young man had
given them, but most of it, of course, went for clothes
for Zloboha.</p>

<p>But in those happy days Dobrunka wasn&rsquo;t worrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
about anything as unimportant as money. She
sat at her wheel and spun away thinking all the while
of her fine young lover. Time sped quickly and before
she knew it she had spun enough for her wedding
shift.</p>

<p>The very day she was finished her lover came. She
heard the trample of his horse and ran out to meet
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you spun enough for your wedding shift?&rdquo;
he asked her as he took her to his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dobrunka said, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can ride away with me this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This moment!&rdquo; Dobrunka gasped. &ldquo;Why so
quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has to be, my dear one. Tomorrow I go off
to war and want you to take my place at home.
Then when I come back you&rsquo;ll be there to greet me
as my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will my mother say to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will have to consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went into the cottage and spoke to the old
woman. She was far from pleased with this arrangement,
for she had worked out a very different plan in
her mind. But what could she do? A rich young
bridegroom always has his own way. So she hid her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
disappointment with a false smile and gave them her
blessing.</p>

<p>Then the young man said to her: &ldquo;Get your
things together, mother, and follow Dobrunka, for I
don&rsquo;t want her to be lonely while I&rsquo;m gone. When
you get to the city, go to the palace and ask for
Dobromil. The people there will tell you where to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka with tears streaming down her cheeks
bid her mother good-by. Dobromil lifted her to the
saddle in front of him and away they went like the
wind.</p>

<p>The town was in great excitement. There was
much hurrying to and fro as the troops were being
put in readiness for the morrow. A crowd had gathered
at the palace gates and as a young man came
galloping up, holding in front of him a lady lovely
as the day, the shout went up:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is! Here he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people in the courtyard took up the cry and
as Dobromil rode through the gate all of them with
one voice shouted out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live our beautiful queen! Long live our
noble king!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka was struck with amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are you really the king, Dobromil?&rdquo; she asked,
looking into his proud and happy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad that I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Dobrunka said, &ldquo;and so whatever
you are makes no difference to me. But why did you
deceive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not deceive you. I told you that your
dream would be realized if you took me for your
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In those early times marriage was a simple affair.
When a man and woman loved each other and their
parents consented to their union, they were looked
upon as married. So Dobromil now was able to present
Dobrunka to his people as his wife.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing, music played, and there
was feasting and drinking in the banquet hall until
dawn. The next day the young husband kissed his
lovely bride farewell and rode off to war.</p>

<p>Left alone the young queen strayed through the
magnificent palace like a lost lamb. She would have
felt more at home rambling through the woods and
awaiting the return of her husband in a little cottage
than here where she was a lonely stranger. Yet she
was not a stranger long, for within half a day she
had won every heart by her sweetness and goodness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
The next day she sent for her mother and the
old woman soon arrived bringing with her Dobrunka&rsquo;s
spinning wheel. So now there was no more excuse
for loneliness.</p>

<p>Dobrunka supposed that her mother would be
made very happy to find what good fortune had befallen
her daughter. The old woman pretended she
was, but in her heart she was furious that a king had
married Dobrunka and not Zloboha.</p>

<p>After a few days she said, very artfully, to Dobrunka:
&ldquo;I know, my dear daughter, that you
think your sister, Zloboha, was not always kind to
you in times past. She&rsquo;s sorry now and I want you
to forgive her and invite her here to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have asked her before this,&rdquo; said Dobrunka,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t suppose she wanted to come.
If you wish it, we&rsquo;ll go for her at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear daughter, I do wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the queen ordered the carriage and off they
went to fetch Zloboha. When they came to the edge
of the woods they alighted and ordered the coachman
to await them there. They went on afoot to the cottage
where Zloboha was expecting them.</p>

<p>Zloboha came running out to meet them. She
threw her arms about her sister&rsquo;s neck and kissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
her and wished her happiness. Then the wicked
sister and the wicked mother led poor unsuspecting
Dobrunka into the house. Once inside Zloboha took
a knife that she had ready and struck Dobrunka.
Then they cut off Dobrunka&rsquo;s hands and feet, gouged
out her eyes, and hid her poor mutilated body in the
woods. Zloboha and her mother wrapped up the
hands and the feet and the eyes to carry them back
with them to the palace because they believed that it
would be easier for them to deceive the king if they
had with them something that had belonged to Dobrunka.</p>

<p>Then Zloboha put on Dobrunka&rsquo;s clothes and she
and her mother rode back to town in the carriage and
nobody could tell that she wasn&rsquo;t Dobrunka. In the
palace the attendants soon whispered to each other
that their mistress was kinder to them at first, but
they suspected nothing.</p>

<p>In the meantime poor Dobrunka, who was not
quite dead, had been found by a hermit and carried by
him to a cave. She awoke to feel a kind hand soothing
her wounds and putting some reviving drops between
her lips. Of course, she could not see who it
was, for she had no eyes. As she regained consciousness
she remembered what had happened and began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
bitterly to upbraid her unnatural mother and her
cruel sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet. Do not complain,&rdquo; a low voice said.
&ldquo;All will yet be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can all be well,&rdquo; wept poor Dobrunka,
&ldquo;when I have no eyes and no feet and no hands? I
shall never again see the bright sun and the green
woods. I shall never again hold in my arms my beloved
Dobromil. Nor shall I be able to spin fine flax
for his shirts! Oh, what did I ever do to you, wicked
mother, or to you, cruel sister, that you have done
this to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hermit went to the entrance of the cave and
called three times. Soon a boy came running in answer
to the call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here till I come back,&rdquo; the hermit said.</p>

<p>He returned in a short time with a golden spinning
wheel in his arms. He said to the boy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, take this spinning wheel to town to the
king&rsquo;s palace. Sit down in the courtyard near the
gate and if any one asks you for how much you will
sell the wheel, say: &lsquo;For two eyes.&rsquo; Unless you are
offered two eyes for it bring it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy took the spinning wheel and carried it to
town as the hermit directed. He went to the palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
and sat down in the courtyard near the gate, just as
Zloboha and her mother were returning from a walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, mother!&rdquo; Zloboha cried. &ldquo;What a gorgeous
spinning wheel! I could spin on that myself!
Wait. I&rsquo;ll ask whether it&rsquo;s for sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went over to the boy and asked him would he
sell the spinning wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I get what I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want two eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two eyes. My father told me to accept
nothing for it but two eyes. So I can&rsquo;t sell it for
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The longer Zloboha looked at the spinning wheel
the more beautiful it seemed to her and the more she
wanted it. Suddenly she remembered Dobrunka&rsquo;s eyes
that she had hidden away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as a queen I ought to have
something no one else has. When the king comes
home he will want me to spin, and just think how
lovely I should look sitting at this golden wheel. Now
we&rsquo;ve got those eyes of Dobrunka&rsquo;s. Let us exchange
them for the golden spinning wheel. We&rsquo;ll still have
the hands and feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
The mother, who was as foolish as the daughter,
agreed. So Zloboha got the eyes and gave them to
the boy for the spinning wheel.</p>

<p>The boy hurried back to the forest and handed
the eyes to the hermit. The old man took them and
gently put them into place. Instantly Dobrunka
could see.</p>

<p>The first thing she saw was the old hermit himself
with his tall spare figure and long white beard. The
last rays of the setting sun shone through the opening
of the cave and lighted up his grave and gentle
face. He looked to Dobrunka like one of God&rsquo;s own
saints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I ever repay you?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for all
your loving kindness? Oh, that I could cover your
hands with kisses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, my child,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;If you
are patient all will yet be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out and soon returned with some delicious
fruit on a wooden plate. This he carried over to the
bed of leaves and moss upon which Dobrunka was
lying and with his own hands he fed Dobrunka as a
mother would feed her helpless child. Then he gave
her a drink from a wooden cup.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the hermit again called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
three times and the boy came running at once. This
time the hermit handed him a golden distaff and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this distaff and go to the palace. Sit down
in the courtyard near the gate. If any one asks you
what you want for the distaff, say two feet and don&rsquo;t
exchange it for anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zloboha was standing at a window of the palace
looking down into the courtyard when she saw the boy
with a golden distaff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come and see! There&rsquo;s
that boy again sitting near the gate and this time he
has a golden distaff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother and daughter at once went out to question
the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want for the distaff?&rdquo; Zloboha
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two feet,&rdquo; the boy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, what will your father do with two feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never ask my father what he
does with anything. But whatever he tells me to do,
I do. That is why I can&rsquo;t exchange the distaff for
anything but two feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, mother,&rdquo; Zloboha said, &ldquo;now that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
a golden spinning wheel, I ought to have a golden
distaff to go with it. You know we have those two
feet of Dobrunka&rsquo;s hidden away. What if I gave them
to the boy? We shall still have Dobrunka&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you please,&rdquo; the old woman said.</p>

<p>So Zloboha went and got Dobrunka&rsquo;s feet, wrapped
them up, and gave them to the boy in exchange for
the distaff. Delighted with her bargain, Zloboha went
to her chamber and the boy hurried back to the forest.</p>

<p>He gave the feet to the hermit and the old man
carried them at once inside the cave. Then he rubbed
Dobrunka&rsquo;s wounds with some healing salve and stuck
on the feet. Dobrunka wanted to jump up from the
couch and walk but the old man restrained her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie quiet where you are until you are all well
and then I&rsquo;ll let you get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka knew that whatever the old hermit said
was for her good, so she rested as he ordered.</p>

<p>On the third morning the hermit called the boy
and gave him a golden spindle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the palace again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and today
offer this spindle for sale. If any one asks you what
you want for the spindle, say two hands. Don&rsquo;t accept
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy took the golden spindle and when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
reached the palace and sat down in the courtyard near
the gate, Zloboha ran up to him at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want for that spindle?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two hands,&rdquo; the boy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thing you won&rsquo;t sell anything for
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to ask what my father tells me to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zloboha was in a quandary. She wanted the golden
spindle, for it was very beautiful. It would go well
with the spinning wheel and would be something to
be proud of. Yet she didn&rsquo;t want to be left without
anything that had belonged to Dobrunka.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But really, mother,&rdquo; she whined, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
why I have to keep something of Dobrunka&rsquo;s so that
Dobromil will love me as he loved her. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m
as pretty as Dobrunka ever was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;it would be better
if you kept them. I&rsquo;ve often heard that&rsquo;s a good way
to guard a man&rsquo;s love. However, do as you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Zloboha was undecided. Then,
tossing her head, she ran and got the hands and gave
them to the boy.</p>

<p>Zloboha took the spindle and, delighted with her
bargain, carried it into her chamber where she had the
wheel and distaff. The old woman was a little troubled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
for she feared Zloboha had acted foolishly. But Zloboha,
confident of her beauty and her ability to charm
the king, only laughed at her.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy had delivered the hands to the
hermit, the old man carried them into the cave. Then
he anointed the wounds on Dobrunka&rsquo;s arms with the
same healing salve that he used before, and stuck on
the hands.</p>

<p>As soon as Dobrunka could move them she jumped
up from the couch and, falling at the hermit&rsquo;s feet,
she kissed the hands that had been so good to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks to you, my benefactor!&rdquo; she
cried with tears of joy in her eyes. &ldquo;I can never
repay you, I know that, but ask of me anything I can
do and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask nothing,&rdquo; the old man said, gently raising
her to her feet. &ldquo;What I did for you I would do
for any one. I only did my duty. So say no more
about it. And now, my child, farewell. You are to
stay here until some one comes for you. Have no
concern for food. I shall send you what you need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobrunka wanted to say something to him, but he
disappeared and she never saw him again.</p>

<p>Now she was able to run out of the cave and look
once more upon God&rsquo;s green world. Now for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
time in her life she knew what it meant to be strong
and well. She threw herself on the ground and kissed
it. She hugged the slender birches and danced around
them, simply bursting with love for every living thing.
She reached out longing hands towards the town and
would probably have gone there running all the distance
but she remembered the words of the old hermit
and knew that she must stay where she was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile strange things were happening at the
palace. Messengers brought word that the king was
returning from war and there was great rejoicing on
every side. The king&rsquo;s own household was particularly
happy, for service under the new mistress was growing
more unpleasant every day. As for Zloboha and her
mother, it must be confessed that they were a little
frightened over the outcome of their plot.</p>

<p>Finally the king arrived. Zloboha with smiling face
went to meet him. He took her to his heart with
great tenderness and from that moment Zloboha had
no fear that he would recognize her.</p>

<p>A great feast was at once prepared, for the king
had brought home with him many of his nobles to rest
and make merry after the hardships of war.</p>

<p>Zloboha as she sat at Dobromil&rsquo;s side could not take
her eyes off him. The handsome young soldier caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
her fancy and she was rejoiced that she had put
Dobrunka out of the way.</p>

<p>When they finished feasting, Dobromil asked her:
&ldquo;What have you been doing all this time, my dear
Dobrunka? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been spinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, my dear husband,&rdquo; Zloboha said in
a flattering tone. &ldquo;My old spinning wheel got broken,
so I bought a new one, a lovely golden one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must show me it at once,&rdquo; the king said,
and he took Zloboha&rsquo;s arm and led her away.</p>

<p>He went with her to her chamber where she had the
golden spinning wheel and she took it out and showed
it to him. Dobromil admired it greatly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Dobrunka,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and spin. I
should like to see you again at the distaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zloboha at once sat down behind the wheel. She
put her foot to the treadle and started the wheel. Instantly
the wheel sang out and this is what it sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Master, master, don&rsquo;t believe her!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She&rsquo;s a cruel and base deceiver!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She is not your own sweet wife!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She destroyed Dobrunka&rsquo;s life!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Zloboha sat stunned and motionless while the king
looked wildly about to see where the song came from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
When he could see nothing, he told her to spin
some more. Trembling, she obeyed. Hardly had she
put her foot to the treadle when the voice again sang
out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Master, master, don&rsquo;t believe her!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She&rsquo;s a cruel and base deceiver!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She has killed her sister good</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And hid her body in the wood!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beside herself with fright, Zloboha wanted to flee
the spinning wheel, but Dobromil restrained her. Suddenly
her face grew so hideous with fear that Dobromil
saw she was not his own gentle Dobrunka. With a
rough hand he forced her back to the stool and in a
stern voice ordered her to spin.</p>

<p>Again she turned the fatal wheel and then for the
third time the voice sang out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Master, master, haste away!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To the wood without delay!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In a cave your wife, restored,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yearns for you, her own true lord!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At those words Dobromil released Zloboha and ran
like mad out of the chamber and down into the courtyard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
where he ordered his swiftest horse to be saddled
instantly. The attendants, frightened by his appearance,
lost no time and almost at once Dobromil was
on his horse and flying over hill and dale so fast that
the horse&rsquo;s hoofs scarcely touched the earth.</p>

<p>When he reached the forest he did not know where
to look for the cave. He rode straight into the wood
until a white doe crossed his path. Then the horse in
fright plunged to one side and pushed through bushes
and undergrowth to the base of a big rock. Dobromil
dismounted and tied the horse to a tree.</p>

<p>He climbed the rock and there he saw something
white gleaming among the trees. He crept forward
cautiously and suddenly found himself in front of a
cave. Imagine then his joy, when he enters and finds
his own dear wife Dobrunka.</p>

<p>As he kisses her and looks into her sweet gentle
face he says: &ldquo;Where were my eyes that I was
deceived for an instant by your wicked sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you heard about my sister?&rdquo; asked
Dobrunka, who as yet knew nothing of the magic
spinning wheel.</p>

<p>So the king told her all that had happened and
she in turn told him what had befallen her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And from the time the hermit disappeared,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
said in conclusion, &ldquo;the little boy has brought me food
every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat down on the grass and together they ate
some fruit from the wooden plate. When they rose
to go they took the wooden plate and the cup away
with them as keepsakes.</p>

<p>Dobromil seated his wife in front of him on the
horse and sped homewards with her. All his people
were at the palace gate waiting to tell him what had
happened in his absence.</p>

<p>It seems that the devil himself had come and
before their very eyes had carried off his wife and
mother-in-law. They looked at each other in amazement
as Dobromil rode up with what seemed to be
the same wife whom the devil had so recently carried
off.</p>

<p>Dobromil explained to them what had happened
and with one voice they called down punishment on
the head of the wicked sister.</p>

<p>The golden spinning wheel had vanished. So
Dobrunka hunted out her old one and set to work at
once to spin for her husband&rsquo;s shirts. No one in the
kingdom had such fine shirts as Dobromil and no one
was happier.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE GOLDEN GODMOTHER</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a wealthy farmer named Lukas
who was so careless in the management of his
affairs that there came a time when all his property
was gone and he had nothing left but one old tumble-down
cottage. Then when it was too late he realized
how foolish he had been.</p>

<p>He had always prayed for a child but during the
years of his prosperity God had never heard him.
Now when he was so poor that he had nothing to eat,
his wife gave birth to a little daughter. He looked
at the poor unwelcome little stranger and sighed, for
he didn&rsquo;t know how he was going to take care of it.</p>

<p>The first thing to be thought about was the
christening. Lukas went to the wife of a laborer who
lived nearby and asked her to be godmother. She
refused because she didn&rsquo;t see that it would do her
any good to be godmother to a child of a man as poor
as Lukas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Lukas, what happens to a man who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
wasted his property,&rdquo; his wife said. &ldquo;While we were
rich the burgomaster himself was our friend, but now
even that poverty-stricken woman won&rsquo;t raise a finger
to help us.... See how the poor infant shivers, for
I haven&rsquo;t even any old rags in which to wrap it! And
it has to lie on the bare straw! God have mercy on
us, how poor we are!&rdquo; So she wept over the baby,
covering it with tears and kisses.</p>

<p>Suddenly a happy thought came to her. She
wiped away her tears and said to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg you, Lukas, go to our old neighbor, the
burgomaster&rsquo;s wife. She is wealthy. I&rsquo;m sure she
hasn&rsquo;t forgotten that I was godmother to her child.
Go and ask her if she will be godmother to mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will,&rdquo; Lukas answered, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll ask her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a heavy heart he went by the fields and the
barns that had once been his own and entered the
house of his old friend, the burgomaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, neighbor,&rdquo; he said to the burgomaster&rsquo;s
wife. &ldquo;My wife sends her greeting and bids
me tell you that God has given us a little daughter
whom she wants you to hold at the christening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The burgomaster&rsquo;s wife looked at him and laughed
in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;My dear Lukas, of course I should like to do
this for you, but times are hard. Nowadays a person
needs every penny and it would take a good deal to
help such poor beggars as you. Why don&rsquo;t you ask
some one else? Why have you picked me out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because my wife was godmother to your child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it? What you did for me at that
time was a loan, was it? And now you want me to
give you back as much as you gave me, eh? I&rsquo;ll do
no such thing! If I were as generous as you used to
be, I&rsquo;d soon go the way you have gone. No! I shall
not walk one step toward that christening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without answering her, Lukas turned and went
home in tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, dear wife,&rdquo; he said when he got there,
&ldquo;it turned out as I knew it would. But don&rsquo;t be
discouraged, for God never entirely forsakes any one.
Give me the child and I myself will carry it to the
christening and the first person I meet I shall take
for godmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weeping all the while, the wife wrapped the baby
in a piece of old skirt and placed it in her husband&rsquo;s
arms.</p>

<p>On the way to the chapel, Lukas came to a crossroads
where he met an old woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you be godmother
to my child?&rdquo; And he explained to her how every
one else had refused on account of his poverty and
how in desperation he had decided to ask the first person
he met. &ldquo;And so, dear grandmother,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;I am asking you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll be godmother,&rdquo; the old woman
said. &ldquo;Here, give me the dear wee thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lukas gave her the child and together they
went on to the chapel.</p>

<p>As they arrived the priest was just ready to leave.
The sexton hurried up to him and whispered that a
christening party was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only that good-for-nothing of a Lukas
who is poorer than a church mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The godmother saw that the sexton was whispering
something unfriendly, so she pulled out a shining
ducat from her pocket, stepped up to the priest, and
pressed it into his hand.</p>

<p>The priest blinked his eyes in amazement, looking
first at the ducat and then at the shabby old woman
who had given it. He stuffed the ducat into his
pocket, whispered hurriedly to the sexton to bring him
the font, and then christened the child of poor Lukas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
with as much ceremony as the child of the richest
townsman. The little girl received the name Marishka.</p>

<p>After the christening the priest accompanied the
godmother to the door of the chapel and the sexton
went even farther until he, too, received the reward
for which he was hoping.</p>

<p>When Lukas and the old woman came to the crossroads
where they had met, she handed him the child.
Then she reached into her pocket, drew out another
golden ducat which she stuck into a fold of the child&rsquo;s
clothes, and said: &ldquo;From this ducat with which I
endow my godchild, you will have enough to bring her
up properly. She will always be a joy and a comfort
to you, and when she grows up she will make a happy
marriage. Now good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a green wand from her bosom and
touched the earth. Instantly a lovely rosebush appeared,
covered with blooms. At the same moment
the old woman vanished.</p>

<p>In bewilderment Lukas looked this way and that
but she was gone. He was so surprised that he didn&rsquo;t
know what had happened. I really think he would
be standing on that same spot to this day if little
Marishka had not begun to cry and by this reminded
him of home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
His wife, meantime, was anxiously awaiting him.
She, poor soul, was suffering the pangs of hunger,
thirst, and bodily pain. There wasn&rsquo;t a mouthful of
bread in the house, nor a cent of money.</p>

<p>As Lukas entered the room, he said: &ldquo;Weep no
more, dear wife. Here is your little Marishka. But
before you kiss the child, take out the christening gift
that you will find tucked away in her clothes. From
it you will know what an excellent godmother she
has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife reached into the clothes and pulled out
not one ducat but a whole handful of ducats!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped and in her surprise she dropped
the ducats and they rolled about in the straw that littered
the wretched floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband! Husband! Who gave you so much
money? Just look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already looked and at first when I saw
them I was more surprised than you are. Now let
me tell you where they come from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lukas related to his wife all that had happened
at the christening. In conclusion he said: &ldquo;When I
saw the old woman was really gone, I started home.
On the way curiosity overcame me and I drew out
the christening present and instead of one ducat I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
found a handful. I can tell you I was surprised but
instead of letting them drop on the ground I let them
slip back into the baby&rsquo;s clothes. I said to myself:
&lsquo;Let your wife also have the pleasure of pulling out
those golden horses.&rsquo; And now, dear wife, leave off
exclaiming. Give thanks to God for that which he
has bestowed upon us and help me gather up the
golden darlings, for we don&rsquo;t want any one coming in
and spying on us just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they began picking them up, they had a new
surprise. Wherever there was one ducat, there they
found ten! When they got them all together they
made a fine big heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, oh, dear!&rdquo; said the woman as she gazed
at the pile. &ldquo;Who knows whether this money will be
blessed to our use? Perhaps that old woman was an
evil spirit who just wants to buy our souls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lukas looked at his wife reprovingly. &ldquo;How can
you be so foolish? Do you suppose an evil spirit
would have gone with me to church, allowed herself
to be sprinkled with holy water, yes, and even herself
make the sign of the cross! Never! I don&rsquo;t say that
she is just an ordinary human being, but I do say
that she must be a good spirit whom God has sent to
us to help us. I&rsquo;m sure we can keep this money with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
a clear conscience. The first question is where to hide
it so that no one can find it. For the present I shall
put it into the chest, but tomorrow night I shall bury
it under the pear tree. And one thing, wife, I warn
you: don&rsquo;t say anything about it to any one. I shall
take one ducat and go to the burgomaster&rsquo;s wife and
ask her to change it. Then I shall go buy some milk
and eggs and bread and flour, and I&rsquo;ll bring back a
woman with me who will make us a fine supper.
Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go to town and buy some clothes and
feather beds. After that what else shall I buy? Can
you guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing to do would be to buy back our
old property&mdash;the house, the fields, and the live stock,
and then manage it more wisely than before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, wife, that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ll do. And
I will manage prudently this time! I have learned
my lesson, I can tell you, for poverty is a good
teacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Lukas had hidden the money in the chest
and turned the key, he took one ducat and went out
to make his purchases. While he was gone his wife
spent the time nursing the child and weaving happy
dreams that now, she was sure, would come to pass.</p>

<p>After a short hour the door opened and Lukas and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
a red-cheeked maid entered. The maid carried a great
pail of foaming milk. Lukas followed her with a
basket of eggs in one hand and on top of the eggs two
big round brown cakes, and in the other hand a load
of feather beds tied in a knot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be with you!&rdquo; said the maid, placing the
milk pail on the bench. &ldquo;My mistress, the burgomaster&rsquo;s
wife, greets you and sends you some milk for
pudding. If there is anything else you need you are
to let her know.&rdquo; The maid curtsied and went away
before the poor woman could express her thanks.</p>

<p>Lukas laughed and said: &ldquo;You see, wife, what just
one ducat did! If they knew how many more we had
they would carry us about in their arms! The burgomaster&rsquo;s
wife has sent us all these things. She is
lending us feather beds until tomorrow and she is
going to send us an old woman to help us out. I told
her our child had received a handful of ducats as a
christening gift. If she comes here to see you, make
up your mind what you&rsquo;re going to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Lukas built a fire. Presently the old woman
came and soon good hot soup was ready. It was just
plain milk soup, but I can tell you it tasted better to
hungry Lukas and his wife than the rich food which
the king himself ate that day from a golden platter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
The next day after breakfast Lukas set out for
town. The burgomaster&rsquo;s wife took advantage of his
absence to visit his wife and find out what she could
about the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear neighbor,&rdquo; she said, after she had made
the necessary inquiries about health, &ldquo;the blessing of
God came into your house with that child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;if you mean the christening
gift, it isn&rsquo;t so very much. A handful of ducats soon
roll away. However, may God repay that good
woman, the godmother. At least we can now buy
back our old farm and live like respectable people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the way home the burgomaster&rsquo;s wife stopped
at the houses of her various friends and gave them a
full account of Lukas&rsquo; wealth. Before noon every
small boy in the village knew that at Lukas&rsquo; house
they had a hogshead of ducats.</p>

<p>In the evening Lukas came back from town driving
a cart that was piled high with furniture and clothing
and feather beds and food. The next day he bought
back his old farm with the cattle and the implements.</p>

<p>This marked the beginning of a new life for Lukas.
He set to work with industry and put into practice
all the lessons that poverty had taught him.</p>

<p>He and his wife lived happily. Their greatest joy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
was Marishka, a little girl so charming and so pretty
that every one loved her on sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear neighbor,&rdquo; all the old women used to say
to the child&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;that girl of yours will never
grow up. She&rsquo;s far too wise for her years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Marishka did very well. She grew up into a
beautiful young woman and one day a prince saw her,
fell in love with her, and married her. So the old
godmother&rsquo;s prophecy that Marishka would make a
happy marriage was fulfilled.</p>

AND THE FAITHFUL LUDMILA</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE GOLDEN DUCK</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a king who had four
sons. One day the queen said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time that one of our boys went out into the
world to make his fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking that very same thing,&rdquo; the
king said. &ldquo;Let us get ready Raduz, our youngest,
and send him off with God&rsquo;s blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Preparations were at once made and in a
few days Raduz bid his parents farewell and set
forth.</p>

<p>He traveled many days and many nights over
desert plains and through dense forests until he came
to a high mountain. Halfway up the mountain he
found a house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop here,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;and see
if they&rsquo;ll take me into service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this house was occupied by three people: old
Yezibaba, who was a bad old witch; her husband, who
was a wizard but not so bad as Yezibaba; and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
daughter, Ludmila, the sweetest, kindest girl that two
wicked parents ever had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day to you all,&rdquo; Raduz said, as he stepped
into the house and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same to you,&rdquo; old Yezibaba answered.
&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for work and I thought you might
have something for me to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; Yezibaba asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you set me to. I&rsquo;m trustworthy
and industrious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yezibaba didn&rsquo;t want to take him, but the old man
wanted him and in the end Yezibaba with very ill
grace consented to give him a trial.</p>

<p>He rested that night and early next morning presented
himself to the old witch and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What work am I to do today, mistress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yezibaba looked him over from head to foot. Then
she took him to a window and said: &ldquo;What do you
see out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a rocky hillside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Go to that rocky hillside, cultivate it,
plant it in trees that will grow, blossom, and bear fruit
tonight. Tomorrow morning bring me the ripe fruit.
Here is a wooden hoe with which to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; thought Raduz to himself, &ldquo;did ever a
man have such a task as this? What can I do on that
rocky hillside with a wooden hoe? How can I finish
my task in so short a time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to work but he hadn&rsquo;t struck three blows
with the wooden hoe before it broke. In despair he
tossed it aside and sat down under a beech tree.</p>

<p>In the meantime wicked old Yezibaba had cooked a
disgusting mess of toads which she told Ludmila to
carry out to the serving man for his dinner. Ludmila
was sorry for the poor young man who had fallen into
her mother&rsquo;s clutches and she said to herself: &ldquo;What
has he done to deserve such unkind treatment? I won&rsquo;t
let him eat this nasty mess. I&rsquo;ll share my own dinner
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited until her mother was out of the room,
then she took Yezibaba&rsquo;s magic wand and hid it under
her apron. After that she hurried out to Raduz, whom
she found sitting under the beech tree with his face
in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be discouraged,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;It is
true your mistress cooked you a mess of toads for your
dinner but, see, I have thrown them away and have
brought you my own dinner instead. As for your
task,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I will help you with that. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
is my mother&rsquo;s magic wand. I have but to strike the
rocky hillside and by tomorrow the trees that my
mother has ordered will spring up, blossom, and bear
fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila did as she promised. She struck the
ground with the magic wand and instantly instead of
the rocky hillside there appeared an orchard with rows
on rows of trees that blossomed and bore fruit as you
watched them.</p>

<p>Raduz looked from Ludmila to the orchard and
couldn&rsquo;t find words with which to express his surprise
and gratitude. Then Ludmila spread out her dinner
and together they ate it, laughing merrily and talking.
Raduz would have kept Ludmila all the afternoon but
she remembered that Yezibaba was waiting for her and
she hurried away.</p>

<p>The next morning Raduz presented Yezibaba a
basket of ripe fruit. She sniffed it suspiciously and
then very grudgingly acknowledged that he had accomplished
his task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do today?&rdquo; Raduz asked.</p>

<p>Yezibaba led him to a second window and asked
him what he saw there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a rocky ravine covered with brambles,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
&ldquo;Right. Go now and clear away the brambles, dig
up the ravine, and plant it in grape vines. Tomorrow
morning bring me the ripe grapes. Here is another
wooden hoe with which to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raduz took the hoe and set to work manfully. At
the first blow the hoe broke into three pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what is going to happen to
me now? Unless Ludmila helps me again, I am lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At home Yezibaba was busy cooking a mess of
serpents. When noonday came she said to Ludmila:
&ldquo;Here, my child, is dinner for the serving man. Take
it out to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila took the nasty mess and, as on the day
before, threw it away. Then again hiding Yezibaba&rsquo;s
wand under her apron, she went to Raduz, carrying in
her hands her own dinner.</p>

<p>Raduz saw her coming and at once his heart grew
light and he thought to himself how kind Ludmila was
and how beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been sitting here idle,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;for at
the first blow my hoe broke. Unless you help me, I
don&rsquo;t know what I shall do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Ludmila said. &ldquo;It is true your
mistress sent you a mess of serpents for your dinner,
but I threw them out and have brought you my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
dinner instead. And I&rsquo;ve brought the magic wand,
too, so it will be easy enough to plant a vineyard that
will produce ripe grapes by tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ate together and after dinner Ludmila took
the wand and struck the earth. At once a vineyard
appeared and, as they watched, the vines blossomed
and the blooms turned to grapes.</p>

<p>It was harder than before for Raduz to let Ludmila
go, for he wanted to keep on talking to her forever,
but she remembered that Yezibaba was waiting for her
and she hurried away.</p>

<p>The next morning when Raduz presented a basket
of ripe grapes, old Yezibaba could scarcely believe her
eyes. She sniffed the grapes suspiciously and then very
grudgingly acknowledged that he had accomplished his
second task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do today?&rdquo; Raduz asked.</p>

<p>Yezibaba led him to a third window and told him
to look out and tell her what he saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a great rocky cliff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go now to that cliff and grind
me flour out of the rocks and from the flour bake me
bread. Tomorrow morning bring me the fresh loaves.
Today you shall have no tools of any kind. Go now
and do this task or suffer the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
As Raduz started off, Yezibaba looked after him
and shook her head suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this,&rdquo; she said to her husband.
&ldquo;He could never have done these two tasks alone. Do
you suppose Ludmila has been helping him? I&rsquo;ll
punish her if she has!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame on you,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;to talk so of
your own daughter! Ludmila is a good girl and has
always been loyal and obedient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Yezibaba said, &ldquo;but just the same I
think I myself will carry him out his dinner today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, old woman! You&rsquo;ll do no such thing!
You&rsquo;re always smelling a rat somewhere! Let the boy
alone and don&rsquo;t go nagging at Ludmila either!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Yezibaba said no more. This time she cooked
a mess of lizards for Raduz&rsquo; dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Ludmila,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;carry this out to the
young man. But see that you don&rsquo;t talk to him. And
hurry back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Raduz had been pounding stones one on another
as well as he could, but he hadn&rsquo;t been able to
grind any of them into flour. As noonday approached
he kept looking up anxiously to see whether beautiful
Ludmila was again coming to help him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; she called while she was yet some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
distance away. &ldquo;You were to have lizard stew today
but, see, I am bringing you my own dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she told him what she had heard Yezibaba
say to her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today she almost brought you your dinner herself,
for she suspects that I have been helping you.
If she knew that I really had she would kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Ludmila,&rdquo; Raduz said, &ldquo;I know very well
that without you I am lost! How can I ever thank
you for all you have done for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila said she didn&rsquo;t want thanks. She was
helping Raduz because she was sorry for him and loved
him.</p>

<p>Then she took Yezibaba&rsquo;s wand and struck the
rocky cliff. At once, instead of the bare rock, there
were sacks of grain and a millstone that worked merrily
away grinding out fine flour. As you watched, the flour
was kneaded up into loaves and then, pop went the
loaves into a hot oven and soon the air was sweet with
the smell of baking bread.</p>

<p>Raduz begged Ludmila to stay and talk to him, but
she remembered that the old witch was waiting for her
and she hurried home.</p>

<p>The next morning Raduz carried the baked loaves
to Yezibaba. She sniffed at them suspiciously and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
then her wicked heart nearly cracked with bitterness
to think that Raduz had accomplished his third task.
But she hid her disappointment and pretending to
smile, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, my dear boy, that you have been able to do
all the tasks that I have set you. This is enough for
the present. Today you may rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night the old witch hatched the plot of boiling
Raduz alive. She had him fill a big cauldron with
water and put it on the fire. Then she said to her
husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, old man, I&rsquo;m going to take a nap but when
the water boils wake me up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Yezibaba was asleep Ludmila gave the
old man strong wine until he, too, fell asleep. Then
she called Raduz and told him what Yezibaba was
planning to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must escape while you can,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for if
you are here tomorrow you will surely be thrown into
the boiling cauldron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Raduz had fallen too deeply in love with Ludmila
to leave her and now he declared that he would
never go unless she went with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Ludmila said, &ldquo;I will go with you if
you swear you will never forget me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
&ldquo;Forget you? How could I forget you,&rdquo; Raduz
said, &ldquo;when I wouldn&rsquo;t give you up for the whole
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Raduz took a solemn oath and they made ready
to flee. Ludmila threw down her kerchief in one corner
of the house and Raduz&rsquo; cap in another. Then she took
Yezibaba&rsquo;s wand and off they started.</p>

<p>The next morning when the old man awoke, he
called out: &ldquo;Hi, there, boy! Are you still asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not asleep,&rdquo; answered Raduz&rsquo; cap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just stretching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently the old man called out again: &ldquo;Here,
boy, hand me my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; the cap answered. &ldquo;Just wait till
I put on my slippers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then old Yezibaba awoke. &ldquo;Ludmila!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Get up, you lazy girl, and hand me my skirt and
bodice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute! In a minute!&rdquo; the kerchief
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Yezibaba scolded. &ldquo;Why
are you so long dressing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one more minute!&rdquo; the kerchief said.</p>

<p>But Yezibaba, who was an impatient old witch, sat
up in bed and then she could see that Ludmila&rsquo;s bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
was empty. That threw her into a fine rage and she
called out to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, old man, what have you got to say? As
sure as I&rsquo;m alive that good-for-nothing boy is gone and
that precious daughter of yours has gone with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they both got up and sure enough neither
Raduz nor Ludmila was to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think now, you old booby!&rdquo; Yezibaba
shouted. &ldquo;A mighty good and loyal and obedient
girl that daughter of yours is! But why do you stand
there all day? Mount the black steed and fly after
them and when you overtake them bring them back
to me and I&rsquo;ll punish them properly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were fleeing
as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ludmila said: &ldquo;Oh, how my left cheek
burns! I wonder what it means? Look back, dear
Raduz, and see if there is any one following us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raduz turned and looked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing following
us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a black cloud in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A black cloud? That&rsquo;s the old man on the black
horse that rides on the clouds. Quick! We must be
ready for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila struck the ground with Yezibaba&rsquo;s wand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
and changed it into a field. She turned herself into the
growing rye and made Raduz the reaper who was cutting
the rye. Then she instructed him how to answer
the old man with cunning.</p>

<p>The black cloud descended upon them with thunder
and a shower of hailstones that beat down the growing
rye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; Raduz cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trampling
my rye! Leave some of it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the old man said, alighting from his
steed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave some of it for you. But tell me,
reaper, have you seen anything of two young people
passing this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul has passed while I&rsquo;ve been reaping, but
I do remember that while I was planting this field two
such people did pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man shook his head, mounted his steed, and
flew home again on the black cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old wiseacre,&rdquo; said Yezibaba, &ldquo;what brings
you back so soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use my going on,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;The
only person I saw was a reaper in a field of rye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You booby!&rdquo; cried Yezibaba, &ldquo;not to know that
Raduz was the reaper and Ludmila the rye! How they
fooled you! And didn&rsquo;t you bring me back just one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
stalk of rye? Go after them again and this time don&rsquo;t
let them fool you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were hurrying
on. Suddenly Ludmila said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why my left cheek burns? Look back,
dear Raduz, and see if there is any one following us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raduz turned and looked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing following
us but a gray cloud in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gray cloud? That&rsquo;s the old man on the gray
horse that rides on the clouds. But don&rsquo;t be afraid.
Only have ready a cunning answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila struck her hat with the wand and changed
it into a chapel. Herself she changed into a fly that
attracted a host of other flies. She changed Raduz into
a hermit. All the flies flew into the chapel and Raduz
began preaching to them.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gray cloud descended on the chapel
with a flurry of snow and such cold that the shingles
of the roof crackled.</p>

<p>The old man alighted from the gray steed and entered
the chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hermit,&rdquo; he said to Raduz, &ldquo;have you seen two
travelers go by here, a girl and a youth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;ve been preaching here,&rdquo; Raduz said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had only flies for a congregation. But I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
remember that while the chapel was building two such
people did go by. But now I must beg you, good sir,
to go out, for you are letting in so much cold that my
congregation is freezing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the old man mounted his steed and flew
back home on the gray cloud.</p>

<p>Old Yezibaba was waiting for him. When she saw
him coming she called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again you bring no one, you good-for-nothing!
Where did you leave them this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did I leave them?&rdquo; the old man said.
&ldquo;How could I leave them when I didn&rsquo;t even see them?
All I saw was a little chapel and a hermit preaching to
a congregation of flies. I almost froze the congregation
to death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a booby you are!&rdquo; Yezibaba cried.
&ldquo;Raduz was the hermit and Ludmila one of the flies!
Why didn&rsquo;t you bring me just one shingle from the
roof of the chapel? I see I&rsquo;ll have to go after them
myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a rage she mounted the third magic steed and
flew off.</p>

<p>In the meantime Raduz and Ludmila were hurrying
on. Suddenly Ludmila said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why my left cheek burns? Look back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
dear Raduz, again, and see if there is any one following
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raduz turned and looked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing following
us but a red cloud in the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A red cloud? That must be Yezibaba herself on
the steed of fire. Now indeed we must be careful. Up
to this it has been easy enough but it won&rsquo;t be easy to
deceive her. Here we are beside a lake. I will change
myself into a golden duck and float on the water. Do
you dive into the water so that she can&rsquo;t burn you.
When she alights and tries to catch me, do you jump
up and get the horse by the bridle. Don&rsquo;t be afraid
at what will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fiery cloud descended, burning up everything it
touched. At the edge of the water Yezibaba alighted
from her steed and tried to catch the golden duck.
The duck fluttered on and on just out of her reach
and Yezibaba went farther and farther from her horse.</p>

<p>Then Raduz leaped out of the water and caught the
horse by its bridle. At once the duck rose on its wings
and flew to Raduz and became again Ludmila. Together
they mounted the fiery steed and flew off over
the lake.</p>

<p>Yezibaba, helpless with rage and dismay, called
after them a bitter curse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
&ldquo;If you, Raduz, are kissed by woman before you
wed Ludmila, then will you forget Ludmila! And you,
ungrateful girl, if once Raduz forgets you then he shall
not remember you again until seven long years have
come and gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raduz and Ludmila rode on and on until they
neared Raduz&rsquo; native city. There they met a man of
whom Raduz asked the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News indeed!&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;The king and his
three older sons are dead. Only the queen is alive and
she cries night and day for her youngest son who went
out into the world and has never been heard of since.
The whole city is in an uproar as to who shall be the
new king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Raduz heard this he said to Ludmila: &ldquo;Do
you, my dear Ludmila, wait for me here outside the
city while I go quickly to the palace and let it be
known that I am alive and am returned. It would not
be fitting to present you to my mother, the queen,
in those ragged clothes. As soon as I am made king
I shall come for you, bringing you a beautiful dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ludmila agreed to this and Raduz left her and
hurried to the castle. His mother recognized him at
once and ran with open arms to greet him. She wanted
to kiss him but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her. The news of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
return flew abroad and he was immediately proclaimed
king. A great feast was spread and all the people
ate and drank and made merry.</p>

<p>Fatigued with his journey and with the excitement
of his return, Raduz lay down to rest. While he slept
his mother came in and kissed him on both cheeks.
Instantly Yezibaba&rsquo;s curse was fulfilled and all memory
of Ludmila left him.</p>

<p>Poor Ludmila waited for his return but he never
came. Then she knew what must have happened.
Heartbroken and lonely she found a spot near a farmhouse
that commanded a view of the castle, and she
stood there day after day hoping to see Raduz. She
stood there so long that finally she took root and grew
up into a poplar tree that was so beautiful that soon
throughout the countryside people began talking about
it. Every one admired it but the young king. He
when he looked at it always felt unhappy and he supposed
this was because it obstructed the view from his
window. At last he ordered it to be cut down.</p>

<p>The farmer near whose house it stood begged hard
to have it saved, but the king was firm.</p>

<p>Shortly after the poplar was cut down there grew
up under the king&rsquo;s very window a pretty little pear
tree that bore golden pears. It was a wonderful little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
tree. No matter how many pears you picked in the
evening, by the next morning the tree would again be
full.</p>

<p>The king loved the little tree and was forever talking
about it. The old queen, on the other hand, disliked
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that tree would die,&rdquo; she used to say.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange about it that makes me
nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king begged her to leave the tree alone but she
worried and complained and nagged until at last for
his own peace of mind he had the poor little pear tree
cut down.</p>

<p>The seven years of Yezibaba&rsquo;s curse at last ran out.
Then Ludmila changed herself again into a little golden
duck and went swimming about on the lake that was
under the king&rsquo;s window.</p>

<p>Suddenly the king began to remember that he had
seen that duck before. He ordered it to be caught
and brought to him. But none of his people could
catch it. Then he called together all the fishermen and
birdcatchers in the country but none of them could
catch the strange duck.</p>

<p>The days went by and the king&rsquo;s mind was more
and more engrossed with the thought of the golden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
duck. &ldquo;If no one can catch it for me,&rdquo; he said at
last, &ldquo;I must try to catch it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to the lake and reached out his hand
after the golden duck. The duck led him on and on
but at last she allowed herself to be caught. As soon
as she was in his hand she changed to herself and
Raduz recognized her as his own beautiful Ludmila.</p>

<p>She said to him: &ldquo;I have been true to you but you
have forgotten me all these years. Yet I forgive you,
for it was not your fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Raduz&rsquo; heart his old love returned a hundredfold
and he was overjoyed to lead Ludmila to the
castle. He presented her to his mother and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is she who saved my life many times. She
and no one else will be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great wedding feast was prepared and so at last
Raduz married the faithful Ludmila.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont">THE STORY THAT NEVER ENDS</p>


<p>(<i>To be told very seriously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a shepherd who had
a great flock of sheep. He used to pasture them
in a meadow on the other side of a brook. One day
the sun had already set before he started home.
Recent rains had swollen the brook so that he and the
sheep had to cross on a little footbridge. The bridge
was so narrow that the sheep had to pass over one
by one.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll wait until he drives them all over. Then
I&rsquo;ll go on with my story.</p>

<p>(<i>When the children grow impatient and beg for a
continuation of the story, they are told that there are
many sheep and that up to this time only a few have
crossed. A little later when their impatience again
breaks out, they are told that the sheep are still crossing.
And so on indefinitely. In conclusion:</i>)</p>

<p>In fact there were so many sheep that when morning
came they were still crossing, and then it was time
for the shepherd to turn around and drive them back
again to pasture!</p>
